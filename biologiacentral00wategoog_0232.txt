216 PHY'POPHAGA.

variegated with the same colour, each of the punctures being also marked with a fuscous
or castaneous dot. 0. vilis differs from 0. judaica, however, in having the third joint of ‚
the antennae shorter than the fourth, the punctures of the elytra coarse and deep, and
the elytra themselves more convex towards the base; the females are narrowernlonger,
and more ovate than the males, We figure a female specimen from J alapa. ¹

Of this species we have received numerous exampleS, varying in the width of the
black vitta of the elytra—vvhich extends along the outer part of the disc nearly to the
apex and then runs rather obliquely inwards to the suture. The disc of the prothorax
is testaceous, sometimes narrowly and obliquely bordered on either side with fuscous
(this border in conjunction with that on the outer part of the disc of the elytra forming
a common hexagonal ring); but in the two specimens from Chihuahua it is fuscous or
piceouS, the base excepted. The antennae are testaceous; the third joint is a little
longer than the second, and shorter than the fourth. On either side of the disc of the

prothorax are some coarse scattered punctureS, not mentioned by Boheman, whose type
I have examined.

70. Coptoeyela evanescens. (Tab. XII. figg. 5; 5 a, antenna.)

Subrotundate‚ convex‚ flavo-testaceous, shining, the margins subhyaline ; the eyes black3 the prothorax with
a transverse black patch at the base, rounded anteriorly and occupying about half the disc; the scutellum
black or piceous, usually flavous at the tip, in some specimens ferrugineus ; the ely-tra with a diluto
rather broad blackish or piceous stripe on the outer part of the disc (in one specimen black and sbarply
defined, in others faint and evanescent), extending inwards to the suture at some distance before the apex,
and forming (with the mark on the prothorax) an oblong annulus, the space enclosed dilute sanguineous
or flavous: the antennae testaceous, with the apical joint infuscate or black3 beneath and the legs tes-
taceous. Antennae rather short, extending to very little beyond the base of the prothorax, slender‚ the
apical five joints a little thickened, joint 3 short, not longer than 2. Prothorax twice as broad as long,
broadly expanded and reticulate at the sides and in front‚ the disc shallowly grooved at the base on either
side of the median lobe, the surface smooth. Elytra nearly three times as long as the prothorax, and much
wider than it at the base, moderately deeply sinuate-emarginate in front‚ conjointly rounded at the apex,

’ with prominent but obtuse humeri3 the disc convex, hollowed behind the humeral callus, with rows of
rather closely placed, moderately coarse punctures, which become very much finer, shallower, and more
remote towards the suture and obsolete before the apex, the interstices quite flat, smooth; the margins
broadly expanded and reticulate, becoming narrow at the apex, smooth, separated from the disc by a
row of deep foveoe. Claws angularly dilated at the base.

Length ‘lg-53, breadth 43—43 millim.
