OOPTOCYCLA. 191

Of the forty·nine specimens before me, thirty-two are typical wemnaeli, three belong to
the var. α (scutiqerula), one each to the vars. β, γ, and e, and eleven to the var. ὃ

(puerilis). We figure a typical wesmaeli from Zapote, the var. β from Cerro de Plumas‚
and the var. ὃ (puerilis) from Cordova.

I have seen nine examples of this insect. The common dorsal patch on the elytra,
which extends to a little beyond tbe middle, and is continued for some distance along
the suture towards the apex, varies in colour from sanguineous or castaneous to black
(or black, with a spot on the humeral calluS, or the outer edge, sanguineous), and it is
usually marked with a yellow or brownish oblique spot near the suture before the
middle; in one specimen (fig. 10) from Cerro Zunil this mark is <·shaped, and nearly
meets the one on the opposite elytron at the suture. The elytra are rather coarsely
seriate-punctate, tho punctures, as usual, becoming almost obsolete on the flavous apical
portion3 the disc (as in 0. amoena διο.) is deeply foveate before the middle. The third
joint of the antennae is much longer than the second. ’

A common insect on the centra] plateau of Guatemala and Mexico; it ranges from
Northern Mexico right down to the State of Panama, but becomes rarer southwards.
The narrow annulus is usually sanguineous or dilute castaneous; but in some specimens
it is bordered externally with black and in others it is partly obliterated. In this and
the following three species the elytra are deeply foveate on the disc before the middle,
and the third joint of the antennae is much longer than the second. We figure a

specimen from Aceituno.
