196 PHYTOPHAGA.

0. immunita, and 0. immunda, Boh„ to the synonymy. cassida fuliqinosa, Oliv. (Ent.
vi. no. 97, p. 971, t. 1. fig. 8), from Gnadeloupe‚ doubtfully placed by Boheman as a
synonym of the South·American Coptocyola cruciata (Linn.)‚ belongs almost certainly to
the dark variety of our species (=0. trabeata or Ο. immunita, Boh.). I have examined
the type of Ο. immunda, Boh.: it is a pale form of 0. szssquerm and has been received
with typical examples from Yucatam Teapa‚ &c.; specimens of 0. Ιιαφηαίαία, Boh.‚ from
San Domingo scarcely differ from it. We figure a typical 0. siquera from Teapa‚ also
a specimen of the var. α (trabeata), from Temax, and of the var. β (immunda), from
Teapa.

24. Coptocyola locontei. (Τὼ. X. fig. 22, ῼ .)

Hah. ΝΟΒΤΗ ΑΜΕΒῙΟΑ, Arizona1.—MExtco‚ Villa Lerdo in Durang0‚ Tupataro in
Guanajuat0‚ Yautepec in MoreIOS, Chilpancingo in Guerrero, Misantla (Ηόρθ), Ventanas

in Durango (Forrer)‚ Guanajuat0‚ Istapan (Sulla), Tepetlapa in Guerrero (H. H.
Smith).

This is probably only a well-marked variety of Ο. siqnif'era, Herbst ( :quttata‚ Boh.) ;
but as it is fairly constant on the central plateau of Mexico and in Arizona, where it
appears to replace 0. siqnaefira, I retain it as distinct. 0. leoontez· chiefly differs from
0. siqnffera in having the black markings on the disc of the elytra completely separated
from the humeral patch by an oblique yellow stripe ; it is also more elongate and
larger, and has a sharply defined rounded black spot on the yellow discoidal markings
near the base. Some specimens from Vera cruz, T apachula‚ and Nicaragua are almost
intermediate between them; and in one from Zapote, Guatemala‚ the humeral patch
is disconnected on one elytron and connected on the other. ln typical C. siqmjfera the
yellow streak exterior to the humeras callus extends about halfway across the dark
humeral ramus; but in some specimens of the vars, immunda and hammam, Boh., the
humeral patch is disconnected. Our figure is taken from a specimen from Tupatar0‚
agreeing with one from Arizona kindly communicated by Dr. Horu.

Hah. Mlmco (Mus, Beroz.1-³).
Apparently a close ally of 0. siquera, var. trabeata.
