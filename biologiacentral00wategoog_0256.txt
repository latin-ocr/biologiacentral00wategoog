Var. The upper surface entirely black.
Hah. Mnxlco, Omilteme and Cuernavaca (H. H. Smitlz). Two specimens.

Sent in plenty by Mr. Smith. It is probable that two species were confused under
this name by Baly, the numerous specimens from Western Mexico differing from those
from Vera Cruz and Tabasco in having the apex of the elytra more finely denticulate
and the row of punctures at the base better defined. The colour is very variable.

Moderately elongate, subparallel, black with an aeneous lustre, shining. Head trisulcate between the eyes, the
vertex with a few scattered punctures. Antennae short, scarcely longer than the head and prothorax
united, exceedingly stout3 the joints cylindrical, 2 and 3 subequal in length, 4-7 strongly transverse,
7 one half wider and very much stouter than 6, 8-11 amalgamated into a single pioee, and together
forming an exceedingly stout oval club, which is blunt at the tip. Prothorax very convex, moderately
transverse, transversely depressed behind, the sides converging from the base, the anterior angles obtuse ;
the surface impressed with scattered, very coarse, deep, rounded punctures. Elytra moderately long,
subparallel for two thirds of their length, conjointly rounded at the apex ς the lateral margin serrulate,
the apical margin finely denticulate 3 each elytron with eight rows of very coarse, deep, foveolate punc-
tureS, which are partly coalescent and form irregular double series separated by raised reticulations;
