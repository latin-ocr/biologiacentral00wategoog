Old World. Many of the Central·American species are large and conspicuous, and
being abundant in the various localities in which they occur, are doubtless (as
Mr. Wallace states) protected from the attacks of birds 81111 011181 8118111188 by the pos-
session of some noxious smell or taste. The 00101811011 81111 markings of the different
species are (with some remarkable exceptions) constant, and show little tendency to
variation; in some groups 8 uniform pattern runs, with but little change, through a
series of specific 1011118, 111 many cases belonging to separate genera.

It will 08 88811 11181 Ι have, as formerly, used the modifications in 8128 81111 shape of
the labium in the arrangement of the generic groups.

The labium is large and exposed, and is thus readily examined in situ by an ordinary
microscope without risk of injury to the specimens3 it is divided into two segments,
the mentum and ligula. “ ’

Ι. The mentum, or basal segment, is connected by its lower edge with the margin of
the skull, and is attached on either side to the maxilla; at first small, and forming a
single piece with the ligula, it gradually increases 111 8128 1111111 ultimately it forms the
larger portion of the whole> labium.

II. The ligula: this segment is placed in one division of the family at the apex, in
the other 011 1118 1101881 surface of the mentum; it 001181818 of two subsegments, the
basilar and apical, which are separated from each other by well-defined sutural lines;
the basilar portion, from the anterior surface of which spring the labial palpi, varies
greatly in size 81111 shape3 in the earlier genera of the family it is large and prominent,
but gradually dwindles away in exact ratio to the increase of the mentum, until at
length (Chondrina) it, together with its appendages, the labial palpi, entirely disappears3
the apical subsegment is 0011180118, 81111 sometimes placed at the apex, sometimes on the
dorsal surface of the preceding subsegment ; in the latter case it is hidden from vieW.

I should not have thought it necessary to make these remarks had not the late
Dr. Chapuis (Gen. 001. t. xi. p. 252) questioned the accuracy of my nomenclature of
these parts, and in so doing fallen into a singular error, which, if not corrected, might
tend to mislead future studente of the group.

After having stated (l. c. p. 255) that the maxillae are attached, one on either side, to
the base of the mentum, he proceeds to say that there is often an additional segment,
the sous-monton, placed between the true mentum and the margin of the head, referring
to Cat. Hisp. tab. i. A a, and fig. 8 f as illustrating the part in question. He thus divides
the labium into three segments :—1‚ a 118881 0118, or sous-mentom 2, an inter-mediate,or
menton3 and 3, the lanquette, which, according to his statement, carries the 1811181 palpi.

Had he, however, examined the parts in nature, for example, in Amr-nus, to which
figure he refers, he would have seen that the maxillae are attached to the short trans-
verse segment (his sous-mentm), showing it, even according to his own views, to be the
true mentum3 had he carried his investigations further, and examined the second
segment, which he terms the menton, he would have found that the labial palpi spring,
