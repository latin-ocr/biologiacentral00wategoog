OHALEPUS. 85

rugose-punctate. Elytra very slightly increasing in width from the base towards the
· posterior angle, thence subacutely rounded to the apex, conj ointly quadrate·emar-
ginate at the sutural angle, distinctly serrulate, the serratures stronger at tlie apex
than on the sides; each elytron with ten, at the extreme base with eleven, rows of
punctures, the second interspace strongly, the fourth and· the eighth more or less
distinctly, costate. ’

Nearly allied to 0. omoqerzw, Crotch. Narrower, the second interspace less strongly
costate, the serratures at the apices of the elytra smaller.

63. Chalepus palmeri.

Interocular space moderately produced, 5-sulcate, the middle sulcus short, terminated
anteriorly by a longitudinal ridge. Antennae less than half the length of the body,
filiform, slightly'thickened beyond the middle; joints cylindrical, the two lower ones
equal, the basal joint slightly thickened, the third nearly equal in length to the
preceding two united, the fourth about two thirds the length of the third, the
seventh to the tenth short, equal, the sixth still shorter, subturbinate. Thorax trans·
verse ; sides straight and nearly parallel from the base to beyond the middle, thence
obliquely converging and slightly sinuate to the apex, the anterior angle armed with
a short oblique tubercle; above transversely convex, flattened and broadly excavated
on the hinder disc ; on either side is a longitudinal ill-defined irregular torulose space,
which extends from the basal nearly to the apical margin ; on the medial line is also a
very fine longitudinal groove. Elytra narrowly oblong, subparallel, rounded at the.
apex, deeply subquadrate-emarginate at the sutural angle; margin serrulate, the apical
serratures rather coarser than those on the side; upper surface granulose ; each elytron
with ten, at the base with eleven, rows of deeply punctured striae; the second inter·
space strongly, the eighth moderately‚ costate, the latter finely serrulate on the hinder
disc, the fourth and sixth faintly costate at the base and apex, the suture also distinctly
elevated; each elytron with a wedge-shaped rufo-fulvous basal patch, which stretches
along the base from the suture nearly to the lateral margin, and extends downwards
(covering the humeral callus) for about one fourth the length of the elytron.
