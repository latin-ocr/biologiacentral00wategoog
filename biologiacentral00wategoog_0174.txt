very narrowly reflexed. scutellum smooth. Elytra three and a half times as long as, and much broader
than, the prothoraX‚ moderately rounded at the sides, convex, with the sides of the disc rather abruptly
declivous and the humeral callus prominent, the humeri rounded; the margins moderately expanded‚
deflexed3 the entire surface thickly, rather coarsely punctate. Beneath sparsely pubescent3 prosternam
deeply sulcate posteriorly. Claws appendiculate.

Length 93-11, breadth 7-83 millim.

Hah. NchRAGUA, Chontales (Belt, Janson).

Three exampleS‚ apparently all femaleS, two with the anteapical patch divided so as
to form a large >-shaped mark on each elytron. This is a species with the elytra
marked very nearly as in one of the varieties of the Mexican 0. juvenca, Boh., from

which its glemona, very shining upper surface distinguishes it at a glauce. The insect
is nearest allied to C. lasciuum, Boh.

Hah. Mamoo 1 2, Cerro de Plumas (Hbqe).

We have received three specimens of this species. Very like 0. quttffera‚ but with
the prothorax black, the apical margin excepted. The elytra are more coarsely and a
little more closely punctured; the spots larger‚ the median one on the disc especially.

23. Chelymorpha epilachnoides. (Tab. VII. fig. 20, 2 .)

ῼ . Ovate, convex, glabrous, moderately shining‚ black, the prothorax with the apex more or less testaceous
on either side, and sometimes with a rufo-testaceous spot on either side of the disc a little before the
middle; the elytra each with four very large flavo-testaceous petebas, together occupying more than half
of the entire surface—one at the base extending nearly to the sature, subquadrate, a similar mark behind
it extending nearly to the middle, the two confluent in one example, an obovate patch below the shoulder
(half on the disc and half on the margin), and an exceedingly large subtriangular patch beyond the
middle, the latter slightly excised on its outer edge and with a small black spot in the centre ; the antennae,
legs, and under sui-face black, the five hasal joints of the antennae testaceous beneath. Head rugosa and
canaliculato between the eyes, the lower part with a few fine scattered punctures ; antennoe extending to
a little beyond the base of the prothorax, the five basal joints smooth and shining. Prothorax convex,
twice as broad as long, deeply arcuato-emarginate in front, the sides very rapidly arcuately converging
from the base, the base deeply emarginate on either side externally‚ the median lobe broad and obtuse,
the hind angles sharp and produced behind3 the disc with an interrupted median groove, sparsely,
minuter punctate; the margins moderately expanded, somewhat rugulosely punctured‚ the outer edge
very narrowly reflexed. Soutellum smooth. Elytra three and a half times as long as, and very much
wider than, the prothorax, moderately rounded at the sides, convex, with the sides of the disc rather
abruptly declivous‚ and the humeral callus prominent, the humeri rounded; the margins moderately
expanded, deflexed3 the entire stu-face thickly, rather coarsely punctate. Beneath sparsely pubescent;
prosternam very deeply sulcate from between the coxoe to the tip. Olaws appendicnlate.

Length lag-13, breadth 9²9} minim.

Hab. Mance, Ventanas in Durango (Hb'qe).
Two exampleS‚ closely agreeing with each other. Another species resembling one of

thesorms of the variable Mexican 0. juvenca, Boh.; but larger and glabrous above. This
last-mentioned character brings 0. epilachnoides near G. lO-stillat-a, 0. quttvfera‚ &c
