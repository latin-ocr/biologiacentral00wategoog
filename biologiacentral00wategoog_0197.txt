CHARIDOTIS. 181

of the elytral series much more numerous. 0. coquam, Boh., from Gayenne, has a very
much larger dorsal patch and the margins very broadly expanded.

5. Charidotis yucatanensis. (Tab. IX. fig. 22.)

’ Subrotundate, very convex, shining, brownish-yellow, the elytra rather broadly bordered with castaneous
along the outer part of the disc, their expanded margins and also those of the prothorax dilnte sordid-
yellow3 the antennas, legs, and under surface testaceous. Antennae, prothorax, and scutellum as in
0. erythrostiyma. Elytra about two and a half times as long as, and at the sides forming a continuone
outline with, the prothorax‚ deeply sinuato-emarginate at the base, and with prominent subacute humeri ;
the disc very convex‚ hollowed behind the humeral callus, and somewhat abruptly declivous behind and
at the sides, with rows of coarse, deep, not very closely placed brownish punctures extending from the
base to the apex, the interstices smooth and rather uneven ς the margins moderately expanded, becoming
very narrow at the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of deep foveae.

Length 5, breadth 4 minim.

Hah. MEnoo, Temax in North Yucatan (Gaumer).

One example. Allied to 0. erythro-stimet, but with the elytra coarsely striate·
punctate and the margins a little more expanded3 the coloration is also very different,

resembling that of various species of Coptooyola and Ctenoohira.

6. charidotis nontalis. (Tab. IX. fig. 24.)

Subrotundate, very convert, shining, bronze-black, the expanded anterior and lateral margins of the prothorax
fiavous and subhyaline3 the antennae and legs testaceous3 beneath blank, the metasternum castaneous,
the ventral segmenta flavo-testaceous. Antennae short, not extending beyond the base of the prothorax,
joint 3 very short, much shorter than, and not nearly so stout as, 2, 4-6 snbequal in length, each nearly
twice as long as 3, 7-11 stout, 9 and 10 as broad as long, 11 twice as long as 10 and acuminate.
Prothorax broadly expanded at the sides and in front3 the disc deeply, obliquely grooved at the base on
either side of the very broadly truncated median lobe, flnely canaliculate in the middle behind, and with
fine scattered puncturas, which extend on to the expanded marg-in, the margins reticulate. Scutellum
very large, almost smooth. Elytra about two and one third times as long as. and at the sides forming
a continuone outline with, the prothorax, deeply sinuato—emarginate at the base, and with moderately
prominent subangular humeri; the disc very convex, deeply bifoveate at the base, and abruptly declivous
behind and at the sides, with interrupted rows of coarse deep punctures extending to the apex, the inter-
stioes smooth, the first to the sixth here and there strongly raised and transversely or obliquely connected
with each other, the humeral callus prominent3 the margins feebly expanded, becoming obsolete at the
apex, smooth, separated from the disc by a row of deep foveae.

Length 43, breadth 3} minim.
Hah. ΜΕΧΙΟΟ, Temax in North Yucatan (Gaumer).

One specimen. A close ally of C. seminulum and 0. furva, Boh., but easily distin-
guishable from either of these species by the irregularly, convexly raised interstices, the
much coarser punctuation, the less expanded margine, and the brassy lustre of the elytra.
