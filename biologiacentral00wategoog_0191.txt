We have received only a single (6) specimen of this specieS, but I have seen
several others. The humeri are less obtuse 111 1116 111616 111611 111 the female, and they
are slightly concave in front in the former sex.

CHERSINELLA.

Antennae short, not reaching the base of the prothorax3 joints 3 and 4 elongate, slender‚ 3 nearly twice 66
long as 2 and slightly longer than 4, 5 a little wider and shorter than 4, 6-11 thickened‚ much stouter
than 5, 9 and 10 subtransverse, 11 nearly twice 66 long 66 10, acuminate3 1-5 almost smooth and
shining; 6-11 densely punctured and opaque. Prothorax nearly twice as broad 66 long, broadly expanded
laterally and in front3 the apex rounded and extending far beyond the head3 the 11666 with a produced,
rather broad, obtuse median lobe, and thence ’10 the obtuse hind angles subtr-uncate. Scntellum trian-
gular, small. Elytra in the male about two and a half times 66 long as, and very much wider than, the
prothorax, narrower and longer in the female, convex, very obtuse at the apex, subtruncate 011 either side
at the 11666 ; the margins broadly expanded and the humeri very oblique 111 the male, narrovver and with
the humeri obtuse 111 the female. Claws broadly angularly dilated on the lower side at the base.

This genus is proposed for the Colombian Caenida heteroptmctata‚ Boh., 6111116601
that cannot possibly be retained in the genus Cass-ida. Chersinella closely approaches
certain species of Phyconota (such as P. picticollis, P. maculiventm, 810.) ; but it has
the antennae differently formed and the claws appendiculate. The humeri are not at
all produced in frent, being oblique in the male and obtuse in the female. The
antennae are short, and have the six outer joints thickened‚ the third and fourth
elongate and slender.

Boheman states that Ο. hetercpunctata has the facies of a Chelymorplza; it differs
from that genuS, however, in the laterally subtruncate base of the prothorax and elytm,

and 111 the short antennae.

Ηαό. Pinum, Tole (Champion).-CoLoMmA 1-3.

A single male specimen from Tole, differing from the type and the two varieties
described in having a long (-shaped mark on the disc of each elytron, instead of
some scattered irregular spots; it is like the var. b, but with the markings longitudinally

confluent.
