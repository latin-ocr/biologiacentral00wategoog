18 (n). Uroplata annulipes. (Ταῦ. ΧΙΠ. fig. 27.)

Moderately elongate, subparallel, rather shining, fulvous3 the elytra flavous towards the suture, with an
oblique narrow piceous stripe on the middle of the disc extending to about one fourth from the base and
becoming evanescent behind, the apex indeterminately fusco-sanguineous3 the antennae piceous3 the eyes
and coxae black; the femora flavous‚ with their outer half (the lower side of the front pair excepted)
piceous; the tibiae fulvous, with their apex pitchy-brown3 the tarsi pitchy-brown3 the body beneath
flavous. Head shining, with a few fine scattered punctures, the front moderately produced ; the interocular
space plane, feebly longitudinally grooved in the middle behind and sharply carinate anteriorly. Antennae
short, a little longer than the head and prothorax united, stont, thickened outwardly ; the joints
cylindrical, 3 much longer than 2 or 4, 4 nearly as long as broad, 5 and 6 transverse, 7 twice as long as
and very much broader than 6,. as broad as long, 8-11 consolidated into a single very stout oval club.
Prothorax transverse, convert, gradually narrowing from the base, deeply transversely depressed behind,
with rather obtuse anterior angles; the surfaee shining, somewhat closely covered with coarse‚ deep,
round punctures. Elytra moderately long, subparallel, finely and equally serrulate at the sides and apex;
the apices rounded, very feebly sinuate near the sutural angle ; each elytron with eight regular rows of
coarse deep punctures, those of the first and second and third and fourth rows exceedingly coarse towards
the base and confluent in pairs3 the second, 'fourth, and sixth interspaces, together with the suture,
costate, the second (except at the base) more strongly than the others, the hasal margin also sharply

raised. Legs stout.
Length 23 lin.

Hah. MEXIOO, Atoyac in Vera Cruz (H. H. Smitlz).

One specimen. This insect is nearest allied to U. coxalqz'oa, Baly; but it is much
less elongate, with the prothorax more sparsely punctured, the elytra with their apices
finely serrulate, the punctures much coarser towards the base and transversely confluent

in pairs; the colour is also very different.

Uroplata westwoodi (p. 112).

To the Mexican localities given, add :—Dos Arroyos in Guerre10‚ Atoyac in Vera
Cruz, Teapa in Tabasco (H. H. sazima), Temax in North Yucatan (Gawmer).

Uroplata fulvopustulata (p. 113).

To the localities given, add z—MExlco‚ Atoyac in Vera cruz, Teapa in Tabasco
(H. Η. Smitk).

Three example& Like the following, an addition to the Mexican fauna.

Uroplata lineaticollis (Ρ. 113).>
To the localities given, add 2—MExlco, Atoyac in Vera Cruz, Teapa in Tabasco
(H. Η. Smitk).

*Seven examples. This species was incorrectly placed in Uroplata by Baly, the apical
four joints of the antennae not being amalgamated into a single piece. It belongs to

Chalepus, as defined by him, and should be placed near 0. productus.
