PHYSONOTA. · 153

Nine specimens. Closely allied to P. humilis, Boh., but of more ovate, more convex
shape; the elytra in the male much wider than the prothoraX, and in both sexes more
rapidly narrowing poste1·iorly; the humeri are broadly rounded in the male.

Guerrero (H. H. Smitlz).

Apparently confined to Central and Western MexicO. As in P. attenuata, the
females are more elongate and have more attenuate elytra than in the males. The
specimens ( 6 ῼ ) labelled P. translucida and P. βαυθοία, Boh., in the Salle collection,
determined‚ 1 believe, by Boheman himself, certainly belong to one species. Ι have
examined one of Boheman's types (ὅ) os P. flaveola‚ kindly communicated by the
authorities os the Berlin Museum. The prothorax (as in some of the allied species)
usually has an oblique fold extending across the expanded margin from the obtuse hind
angles to the disc, a character not mentioned by Boheman.

A specimen from Parada, agreeing perfectly with one of Boheman’s types of P. fluveola
in the Berlin Museum‚ is figured.

25. Physonota eucalypta. (Tab. IX. fig. 8.)
Physomta eucalypta, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv. p. 252 ¹.

Hah. Bm'rlsH HONDURAS, R. Sarstoon (Blancaneauxk GUATEMALA (Saue), Chiacam,

Senahu‚ Chacoj, Sabo, San J oaquin, and San Geronimo in Vera Paz, Aceituno (Oltam-
pion), Coban (Com-adt) ς Cos'rA R1cA1.

This is a large species closely resembling Platyoycla demta, Boh.; but it is narrower
than that insect, and has the elytra less deeply emarginate at the base, the base of the
prothorax not nearly so obliquely truncate at the sides.

26. Physonota maculiventris. (Ταῦ. ΙΧ. fig. 9, «ς .)

Physonota maculiventvis, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 229 ¹, and iv.-253¹; Cat. Col. Ins. Brit. Mus.
ix. p. 102⁸.

Hah. anoo 1‘3 (coll. Baly), Cordova (Sam), Oaxaca (Hbqe), Chiapas (Mus. Bria).

In this species the tibiae are obtusely dilated at the apex, a peculiarity not mentioned
by Boheman, though he gives a similar character for the Mexican Omoplata maculioollis.
