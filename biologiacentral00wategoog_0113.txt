Vera Paz ( Champion). ’

Vertex and frent deeply sulcate; clypeus transverse, produced, its upper edge sub-
angulate. Antennae nearly half the length of the body, slightly thickened towards the
apex; joints subcylindrical. Thorax transverse, subconic; sides converging from base
to apex, obsoletely angulate; disc coarsely and closely punctured, a broad submarginal

torulose, impunctate vitta on either side, fulvous. Elytra subparallel, very slightly
increasing in width towards the apex; the latter rounded, broadly subquadrate-emar·
ginate at the suture, the lateral margin finely‚ the apical one more strongly and some·
what irregularly, serrulate; each elytron with eight, at the extreme base with nine,
regular rows of punctures; the second, fourth, and sixth interspaces costate, the last

less distinctly raised than the two others, .
Very similar in the emargination of the elytra to U. efflanata, but the form of the

antennae is entirely different 3 the elytra are less dilated at the apeX, their upper surface
with an additional row of punctures at the base.

οο.’ Apices of the elytra entire.

Head tinged with aeneous3 vertex and front impressed with three to five longitudinal
grooves3 clypeus produced, transverse, trigonate. Antennae rather longer than the head
and thorax, slightly thickened towards the apex ; joints cylindrical, the club very slightly
compressed. Thorax transverse; sides converging from base to apex, bisinuate3 upper
surface transversely convert, transversely excavated on the hinder disc, closely and strongly
punctured; a subtorulose vitta on either side, rather less closely punctured than the disc,
fulvous. Elytra broader than the thorax, parallel on the sides, obtusely rounded at the
apex; lateral margin finely, the apical one rather more distinctly, serrulate3 each elytron
with eight, at the extreme base with nine ¹³, rows of punctures; the suture, together
with the second, fourth, and sixth interspaces, moderately costate.

⁴* In this speeies the short sutural stria is represented only by one or two punctures.
