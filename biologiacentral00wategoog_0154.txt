138 PHYTOPHAGA.

posterior spot on each elytron reduced in size; the second has the elytra more finely
punctured‚ and all the spots very small. Μ eleqans is confined to the Pacific slope of
Mexico and Guatemala‚ extending southwards to Nicaragua. The allied M. tristiqma‚
Boh., varies in a similar way. M. chevrolati is included in Henshaw's ‘ List of the
Coleoptera of America north of Mexico‚' p. 14, probably in mistake‚ as it does not
appear to extend north of the Mexican State of Vera GruZ. A remarkable peculiarity
about these species is, that the red markings of the elytra are always accompanied by
a very much coarser system of punctuation, such not being the case in Μ illustri-3,
Μ lebasi, &c. Boheman 9 mentions a variety with the posterior spot on each elytron
obsolete; we have not received a specimen of it. We figure a pair of M. pumicem also
the type ( ὅ) of M. chevrolati‚ and the type ( ῼ ) of Μ eleyon-3, from the Stockholm
Museum.

A common insect in ,the Mexican States of Vera Gruz and Tabasco. In Guatemala
it has only been found on the Pacific slope. As in Μ. punicea, the spots on the elytra
vary greatly in size‚ frequently becoming coalescent. In one specimen from Tabasco
they are exceedingly small, there being two on one elytron and three on the other.
Μ tn‘stiqma may be easily known in all its varieties from Μ. pumicea by its less gibbous
elytra, more angular humeri, and more shining upper surface3 the males are also more
rounded‚ and the females more parallel, in shape. The N icaraguan specimens have the
