COPTOCYCLA. 183

Coptooycla‚ after the exclusion of the species with pectinate claws, still includes many
heterogeneous forms, some of which will have to be separated eventually. It is one'of
the most characteristic genera of Goleoptera in Tropical America, and includes a very
large number of species, many of which are brilliantly metallic in life. Seventy-nine
representatives are here recorded from within our limits, as against six from the United
StateS‚ the species becoming more numerous southwards‚ where some of them may be
said to swarm. The genus is very widely distributed‚ but has its headquarters in
Tropical America.

The metamorphoses of two of the Mexican specieS, 0. opulenta and 0. bffomlata
(dubitabilis), Boh.‚ have been fully described and figured by Dr. E. Duges (Ann. Soc. Ent.
Belg. 1887, pp. 143-146‚ t. 2. figg. 1-13).

The annexed Table is added to assist in the identification of the Central-American
species:—

Claws simple.
Antennae with the third joint elongate, almost or quite twice as long as the
second (still longer in species 4 and 5).
Elytra very feebly emarginate at the base; the humeri not prominent3
antennae comparatively short and stout. Species large, resembling
Phyconota in shape ................. Species 1-3.
Elytra more or less deeply sinuate-emarginate at the base.
Humeri moderately prominent.
Elytra gibbous, the margins translucent 3 antennae elongate. Species
large (= Psalidonota, Boh.) ............. Species 4-7.
Elytra convex (somewhat gibbous in C. orbiculata).

The margins entirely translucent ............ Species 8-18.
The margins with two transverse dark fasciae ........ Species 19-21.
The margins with a transverse dark fascia at the base only . . . Species 22-25.
Humeri very prominent (still more so in ὅ).
Elytra gibbous3 margins with a transverse dark fascia at the base . . Species 26.
Elytra convex3 margins entirely translucent ......... Species 27.

Antennae with the third joint not or very little longer than the second.
Elytra very feebly emarginate at the base; the humeri not prominent3 the
margins very broadly expanded to the apex, entirely translucent . . Species 28.
Elytra more or less deeply sinuate-emarginate at the base (more feebly in
species 41-43) 3 the margins narrowing posteriorly.
Antennae comparatively stout3 elytral margins translucent ..... Species 29.
Antennae slender.
Elytra gibbous, very obtuse behind 3 the margins with two broad curved
dark fasciae, partly enclosing an oblong translucent space . . . Species 30.
Elytra convex.
The margins entirely translucent 3 punctuation of disc fine or
moderately fine ................ Species 31-40.
