214 PHYTOPHAGA.

-from sanguineous or vermilion·red to dilute flavo-testaceous; the margins have a large
flavo-hyaline space before the middle, which is bordered with black (broadly in front

and behind), except along the outer limb. In pallid examples the humeri are usually
rufo-testaceous; the latter have usually a few scattered coarse punctures, but these

are sometimes obsolete, The third joint of the antennae is elongate, as long as the
fourth. We are indebted to Dr. Horn for a specimen of 0. arizonae, Crotch ; it differs

in no way from Boheman’s species, We figure an example from Soledad.

Not uncommon in TabascO. Very closely allied to 0. emarqinata, but smaller‚ the
elytra invariably dilute flavous or flavo-testaceouS, with the subhyaline space on the

margins more extended and narrowly bordered with piceous or fuscous within, this
border being sometimes almost obsolete, the humeri smooth and not stained with

rufo-testaceous. A specimen from Teapa is figured.

66. Coptocycla tumida. (Tab. XII. figg. 1 ; 1 a, profile.)

Subcordate, very convex, shining, flavo-testaceous3 the elytra each with two fuscous-spotted flavo-testaceous
’ fascioe extending across the margin from the disc but not reaching the exterior limb—one very broad and
transverse, at the base, the other narrower and oblique, a little beyond the middle,—a broad quadrangular
space between the fasciae and the rest of the margin flavo-hyaline; the antennae flavo-testaceous‚ with
the apical five joints black; beneath and the legs black‚ variegaoed with testaceous‚ the metasternum
broadly flavous in front, the fasciae on the elytral margins fuscous. Antennae elongate, slender, the
apical five joints thickened, joint 3 a little longer than 2 and very much shorter than 4. Prothorax
about twice as broad as long, strongly sinuate at the base on eit-her side of the median lobe, broadly
expanded at the sides andin front, smooth3 the disc deeply foveate at the base on either side of the
median lohe, canaliculato behind, and deeply excavato at the sides ‚² the margins reticulate and
subhyaline. Elytra very much wider than, and more than three times as long as, the prothorax‚ deeply
sinuato-emarginate at the base, with prominent rounded humeri3 the disc uneven, moderately gibbous
anteriorly, excavate on either side of the suture in front of this, bifoveate at the base, deeply irregularly
foveate in the centre at about one-fourth from the base and also irregularly foveate towards the sides
a little beyond the middle, hollowed laterally behind the humeral callus, and with rows of deep, coarse,
dilute fuscous punctures, the interstices smooth and here and there connected by feebly-raised transverse
callosities: the margins broadly expanded‚ becoming narrow at the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated
from the disc by a row of very deep foveae. Claws angularly dilated at the base.

One specimen, contained in Mr. O. E. J anson’s collection. This species approaches
C. tuberculata (Fabr.) ; but it has the elytra less gibbous and more coarsely punctured‚
