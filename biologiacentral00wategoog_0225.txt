Var. 71:¹1 The dar-k markings on the elytral margin entirely obliterated, the antemedian hyalino space distinct.
( 'g. 21.)

Hah. N chRAGUA, Ohontales (Bezt, Jcmson). Two specimens.

We have received three examples of the typical form of this specieS‚ including one
determined by Boheman himself, which we figure (fig. 20), as well as one of the
varieties. The specimens from Nicaragua and the State of Panama 1 have no doubt
belong to the same specieS, differing only in the partial or entire absence of the dark
markings before and behind the antemedian hyaline space on the elytral margins,
As in 0. tuberculata, 0. vem-icam, δια, the upper surface in dried specimens varies
in colour from vermilion-red to flavo-testaceouS.

Apparently a common insect in Tropical America‚ extending as far north as
Chiriqui. The elytra in this species have the disc variegated with black or castaneous,
each of the punctures-—which are fine and remote—being placed on a similarly-
coloured dot, the suture being also narrowly castaneous. The third and fourth joints
of the antennae are elongate and equal in length.
