ISOHYROSONYX.
Isclnyrosonyoe, Chevmlat, Dej. Cat. ard edit. p. 394 (1837) 3 Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 321.

The six representatives of this genus described by Boheman are all from Tropical
South America—three from Colombia, and three from Brazi13 an example of one of the
Colombian species was obtained in Nicaragua by the late Mr. T. Belt. Isohyrosonyoe
hoffles, Dohrn, from the Transvaal, has pectinated claWS, and it therefore cannot belong
to this genus, in which the claws are simple.

CASSIDA.

cassida, Linnaeus, Syst. Nat. lzth edit. i. 2, p. 547 (1767) ¹ 3 Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 329
(part.) ² ; Chapuis, Gen. Col. xi. p. 388 ⁸.

Boheman 2 placed a heterogeneous assemblage of species from all parts of the world
under the name Cassida, including some (from the Old World) with pectinate claws‚
some with appendiculate claw8, and some (the majority) with the claws simple ; those
with the claws pectinate have been transferred to Aspidomorplza by Chapuis ³. Three
out of the four species here recorded from within our limits have the claws angularly
dilated on the lower side at the base, but it is inadvisable to separate them from Cassida
at present; they bear much the same relation to Cassi-da as Chirida does to Coptooyola.
Upwards of 250 species of Cassida have been described, about twenty only of which
are from America (not more than seven of these inhabiting the United States), where
the genus is replaced by Coptocycla and Ctenoohira.

⁴* Elytra more or less conver.

a. Claws simple.

1. cassida mexicana. (rab. IX. fig. 14.)

Oblong ovate, convex‚ shining; red or yellowish-red, the expanded margins of the prothorax and elytra diluto
yellow, the scutellum more or less infuscate ; the elytra with the hasal edge, the suture very narrowly,
and three elongate streaks—one on the third interstice about the middle, the other two on the eighth
interstice (one beyond, the other before the middle)—dilute black3 the antennae testaceous, with the five

· apical joints blaek; beneath black3 legs pitchy-red or pieeous. Antennoe short, extending to a little
beyond the base of the prothorax, joints 1-6 smooth and shining, 7 -11 densely punctured and pubescent‚
3-5 sumqual, each longer than 2, 6 shorter than 5 (not longer than 2), 7-11 considerably thickened‚
7-10 about as broad as long, 11 twice as long as 10, subacuminate. Prothorax nearly twice as broad as
long, broadly dilated at the sides and in front, almost smooth. Scutellum large, triangular, acuminato
behind, smooth. Elytra a little wider than, and about three times as long as, the prothorax, subpar-allel
nearly to the middle, deeply sinuate-emarginate at the base3 the disc with rows of rather coarse sub-
approximate punctures extending to the apex and a deep sutural stria, the interstices smooth, almost fiat;
