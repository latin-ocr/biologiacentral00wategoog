Tribe PHYTOPHAGA (continued).
Fam. HISPIDAE.

A large number of the Hispidae contained in the present work are now described for
the first time; but although so many of the species are new to scienee, all, with but
two exceptione, belong to known generic groups ; two new genera, waema and Para-
ehalepus, are characterized in the following pages. The New-World genera Cladi-spa,
Ootooladismos, Melaniepa, Hdffloleptis, Meta-zyoera, &ethi-spa, Acentroptera, and Steno-
podius ¹* are as yet unrepresented in Central America; the last-named genus, however,
recently established by Dr. Horn for the reception of a species from California and
Arizona, will probably be found in Northern Mexico.

Little is known of the habits of the exotio species of the family3 but Mr. Champion,
who during his residence in Central America paid great attention to the group, tells
me that the smooth flattened species ( Cephaloleia and its allies) are usually found in
the rolled-up unopened leaves of Musaceae (Heliconia, spp.), the inner surfaces of
the leaves being eroded or eaten through (often for five or six thicknesses of the
rolled-up leaves) to a considerable extent3 he took a long series of &eni-spa attenuata,
a smooth metallic insect, by sweeping undergrowth (Bambusaceae), at a high elevation
in the virgin forest; he also states that he captured, both in the forests and in the
more open savanna country, the brightly coloured species of Are-wne on the upper
surfaces of leaves, basking in the full sunshine. Mr. Bates‚ who made a large collection
of these interesting insects in the Amazon region, used to find numerous species of
Cephaloleia hidden at the bases of bamboo-canes, lying between the leaves and the stem

As a rule, the New·World Hispidae are more brilliantly coloured than those of the

¹* Βίεηοροᾱὴιεβαυίἆαε, Hom (Trans. Amor. Ent. Soc. 1883, p. 301, t. 9. f. 8), a remarkable speeies, possessing
a similarly shaped thorax to Ewema ς but judging from the structure of its antennoe, and from the slight de-
scription given of ite labium, it should belong to the second section of the family, and be ΡΜ near Uroplata.
