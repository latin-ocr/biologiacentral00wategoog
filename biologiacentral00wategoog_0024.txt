Head smooth3 antennae nearly three fourths the length of the body, filiform, first
and second joints short, nearly equal in length. Thorax nearly twice as broad as long
at the apex3 sides broadly reflexed, straight, and obliquely converging from the base to
beyond the middle, thence rounded and converging towards the apex ; disc impunctate,
sides at the base impressed with a few large foveolate punctures. Elytra much broader
than the thorax, quadrate-ovate, flattened 011 1110 (1130, transversely depressed below
the base, outer limb broadly reflexed3 coarsely punctate-striate, interspaces obsoletely
wrinkled3 outer limb impunctate.

Antennae half the length of the body, filiform, attenuated at base and apex3 joints
cylindrical, the basal one rufo-testaceous, the rest black. Thorax transversely convex;
sides nearly straight, scarcely converging from the base to beyond the middle,
thence rounded and converging to the apex3 anterior angle produced, obtuse 3 apical

CEPHALOLEIA.

Cephalokia, Blanchard, Hist. des Insectes, 11. p. 1823 Baly, Cat. Hispidae, p. 39.

With the exception of six, all the species described below are new to science; many
of these 310 closely allied to Colombian forms, but are separated by good structura]
characters. Cephaloleia is one of the few genera in the family in which important
characters can be drawn in both sexes from the emargination of the anal segments of

he abdomen.
t Mr. Champion informs me that the Central-American species of this genus are, with

one or two exceptions, found in the rolled-up unopened leaves of Musaceae in damp
places in the forests, often in company with species of Oarabidae ( Calophoena). In fine
weather these insects are to be 30011 sunning themselves on the leaves3 many of the
species are gregarious ; the young tender juicy leaves of these plants form 111011

principal food.
