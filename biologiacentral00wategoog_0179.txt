I have seen a dozen specimens of this species, including those from Guatemala, in
the British Museum, named by Boheman 3. The prothorax in southern specimens is
sometimes entirely rufo-testaceous. B. insidiosa resembles B. nodosa 3 but it is
, considerably larger, the elytral elevation is not so prominent, the exterior limb is
blackish-aeneous, and the prothorax is usually black, the anterior margin excepted.
The five Panama examples have the elytral elevation a little stronger and more acute
than in those from Gnatemala.

5. Batonota sexplagIata. (Tab. VIII. figg. 63 6 a, profile.)
Batonota sexplayiata, Wag. Mittheil. Miinch. ent. Ver. v. pp. 44, 47 ¹.

Hah. GUATEMALA, El Reposo, Zapote (Champion) ; NIGARAGUA, Rio Tipetape 1.

Three specimens of a Batonota from the Pacific slope of Gnatemala agree with
Wagener’s description 1 of B. sexplaqiata, except that they have the ground-colom of
the elytra green (instead of black), and the head, underside, and legs entirely black.
The anterior edge of the broadly expanded margin of the elytra, is straight to the
humeral angle, this part being distinctly concave in the closely allied B. rufo-ornata.

6. Batonota rufo-ornata. (Tab. VIII. figg. 7 ; 7 a, profile.)
Batonota rufo-ornata, Baly, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond. 1869, p. 86 ¹.
Batonota jansom', Baly‚ op. cit. 1872, p. 71 ².

Hah. NIOARAGIJA 1, Chontales (Janson 2, Bezt).

By mistake, Baly described this species twice. I have seen ten specimens of it,
varying only in the ground-colour of the elytra, from greenish-aeneous to bluIsh-black

or black. The type is figured.

7. Batonota godmani· (Tab. VIII. figg. 9 3 9 a, profile.)
Batonota yodmam'i, Baly, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond. 3rd ser. ii. p. 242 (1864) ¹.

Hah. Pinum 1, Lion Hill (M‘Leamum).

Three examples of this species are contained in the Baly collection, one of which is

figmed.
