COPTOOYGLA. 207

from Panama and southwardS, have the marginal fascioe of the elytra broader and more
diffuse than usual, and the tubercular elevatione on the posterior portion of the disc
more strongly raised. The variety is connected with the type by intermediate forms.
0. ramosa, Boh.‚ from Merida‚ is an allied form3 but it differs from 0. testudinum
and its allies in having much more feebly gibbous elytra.

A specimen from Misantla is figured.

I have only seen three examples of this insect‚ including one from Chevrolat (no
doubt one of Boheman’s types) in the British Museum. O. asperata is perhaps only
a variety of O. testudinaria with the posterior transverse patch on the elytral margins
obliterated.

This is one of the most characteristic speties of the family within our limits‚ and
it has been found abundantly in some parts of Guatemala. O. nitida, Boh., was based
upon a large pallid discoloured female example, and Ο. lobata, Boh.‚ upon specimens
with the pro· and metastemum and , fifth ventral segment partly black. These
characters are not of the slightest value when a large series of specimens is examined.
0. tuberculata and 0. lobata were collected together iu large numbers by myself at
