112 PHYTOPHAGA.

acute, the two lower joints ovate, short, equal, very slightly thickened, the third equal in
length to the preceding two united. Thorax broader than long; sides nearly straight,
converging from base to apex ; upper surface transversely conveX, the hinder disc faintly
excavated on either side the medial line, coarsely and deeply punctured3 a broad sub·
torulose vitta on either side near the latera] margin less closely punctured. Elytra
parallel, very slightly dilated at the obsolete hinder angle 3 apex rounded; apical
margin dilated, broadly emarginate at the suture3 sides finely, the apex rather more
strongly, serrulate; each elytron with ten, at the extreme base with eleven, ‚rows of
deep punctures; the second and fourth interspaceS, together with the suture, moderately ,
costate‚ the eighth interspace obsoletely elevated.

33. Uroplata westwoodi. (Tam. lv. fig. 17.)

Elongata‚ parallela, nigra3 subtus nitida, thorace, abdominis limbo angusto femoribusque subtus, flavis; supra
subopaca 3 capite sordide fulvo, vertice antennisque nigris ; thorace transverso, lateribus angulatis ;
crebre punctato, sordide fulvo, lateribus vittaque lata discoidali, hoc soepe ante apicem abbreviata, nigris ;>
scutello nigro; elytris parallelis, lateribus obsolete serrulatis3 apice rotundatis, fortius sed minus regu-

inter-spatiis quarto apice, sexto basi, nec non octavo toto, minus distincte elevatis ; callo humerali lateraliter

Vertex smooth, opaque; interocular space produced, its apex angulate. Antennae·
rather more than one third the length of the body, filiform, very slightly thickened
towards the apex3 join ts cylindrical. Thorax transverse3 sides straight and parallel .
to the middle, thence obliquely converging to the apeX, the apical angle not produced ;
upper surface transversely conveX, broadly depressed on the hinder disc, opaque, closely
punctured ; obscure fulvous, the latera] margin, a broad discoidal vitta (the latter some--
times abbreviated anteriorly) together with the apical margin, black. Scutellum black.
Elytra parallel, rounded at the apex; the lateral margin obsoletely serrulate, the apical
one rather coarsely serrate, the apical teeth sometimes placed at irregular intervals along
the margin ; each elytron with ten, at the extreme base with eleven, rows of punctures3
the second interspace strongly costate‚ the fourth interspace at its apex, the sixth at the
base, and the entire eighth, less strongly raised.

This species is very closely allied to U. infuscata, ChapuiS, the chief difference being
in the rather broader and less strongly punctured thorax in the latter insect. U. west-
woodi varies greatly in the extent of the fulvous colouring; in some specimens from
Colombia the marginal vitta on the elytron is submarginal for nearly the whole of its
course, and is continued onwards to join the apical spot3 in others the fulvous coloration
covers to a greater or lesser extent the outer disc.
