162 PnY'rornAeA.

Apparently not uncommon in Western Mexico. The prothorax is deeply foveate on
either side of the middle at the base, a character not mentioned by Boheman; some
specimens have a brownish (-shaped mark on either side of the disc, the two marks
often connected in frent, but this may be partly due to discoloration. A specimen

from Ventanas is figured.

2. Batonota Yucatan& (Tab. VIII. figg. 35 3 a, profile.)

Obtusely triangular, the prothorax shining, the elytra subopaque3 castanaeus or yellowish castaneous3 the
antennae piceous, with the five basal joints testaceous3 the legs and the body beneath testaceous or rufo-
testaceous, the tibiae sometimes stained with piceous above. Head canaliculato and punctured between
the eyes3 antennae rather short and slender, not extending beyond the humeri, joints 1-5 almost smooth,
shining‚ 2 and 3 very short, subequal, 4 and 5 twice as long as 3, equal, 6-11 densely punctured and
opaque, 6 barely the length of 4 and 5 united, 6-10 subequal in length, 11 longer than 10. Protborax
strongly transverse, feebly arcuate-emarginate in frent (truncate if viewed from above), the sides very
rapidly and abruptly eonverging from the base, a little rounded behind, the base deeply emarginate on
either side of the broad emarginate median lobe and thence to the hind angles very obliquely truncate;
the dise transversely convex, hollowed on either side in frent (appearing longitudinally raised in the middle

' at the apex), and with a shallow fovea on either side of the median lobe at the base; the margins feebly
expanded, the exterior edge slightly reflexed3 the entire surfaee very sparsely, finely punctate. Scutellum
flat, almost smooth. Elytra at the base one and a half times the width of the prothei-ax, obtusely triangular,
bluntly rounded at the apex, narrowing from the base, the sides sinuate behind the humeri 3 armed with
a very long, ercet, compressed‚ obtuse spine before the middle; the disc very coarsely‚ subseriately
punctured, the punctures not very closely placed, and with indicatione of two or three irregular costae,
the interstices with very minute scattered punctures3 the margins narrowly expanded, with a series of
very coarse, deep, transverse foveae extending from the middle to the apex, almost smooth in front3 the
humeri moderately prominent, rounded exteriorly and in frent, and with an oblique carina extending
inwards to the humeral callus. Beneath very shining, almost smooth, the apex of each ventral segment
epm-sely punctured and pubescent ; prosternam flat and almost unimpressed behind, more or less foveate
in the middle in frent.

Length (ist—73, breadth 52-ss minim.

Hah. Mance, Temax in North Yucatan (Gaumer).

Numerous exampleS. This small species is allied to B. aurita, Boh. ; but it is much
smaller and darker than that insect‚ the prothorax is more transverse, and the coarse

punctures on the elytra are not nearly so numerous, the interstices flatter and sub-
opaque. The punctures on the elytral interstices are only visible under a strong lenS.

ii. Εἰρήνα with a compressed‚ acute or triam-qulam transverse elevatiora before the middle.

Not uncommon in Chiriqui, where ¹it has been found on the calabash-tree, arescentia

majnto. I have compared our specimens with one from Colombia in the British
Museum‚ named by Boheman himself.
