238 APPENDIX.

Chalepus chromaticus (pp. 70, 121).
To the Mexican localities given, add z—Atoyac in Vera Cruz (H. H. sz‘tk).

Chalepus propinquus (p 71)
To the localities given, add Μ-ΜΕΧῙΟΟ Teapa 1n Tabasco (Η. Η. Smilla).

Three specimens.

chalepus angulosus (pp. 73‚121).
To the localities given, add: -ΜΕΧῙΟΟ, Teapa in Tabasco (H. H. Smitlz); GUATEMALA,
Panzos (Champion).

Chalepus subhumeralis (p. 74).

To the localities given, add :—M1·:xtco, Atoyac in Vera Cruz, Teapa in Tabasco
(H. H. Smiz‘lz).

45 (A). chalepus maculicollis.

Elongate, rather nan-ow, subparallel, slightly shining3 black, the prothorax with an oblong fulvous vitta on
either side ; the legs and antennae black. Head subopaque‚ almost smooth; the front moderatoly
produced, the interocular space longitudinally grooved in the middle behind, feebly carinate anteriorly,
and with a short shallow groove on either side. Antennae short, not one third the length of the body,
thickening outwardly; the joints cylindrical, 3 a little longer than 2 and much shorter than 4, 4 and 5
about as broad as long, 6-10 transverse, 11 much longer than 10, acuminate. Prothorax strongly trans-
verse, convex, narrowed anteriorly, with rather prominent dentiform anterior angles, the sides bisinuate;
the surface (a smooth space down the middle excepted, this being finely canaliculato in the centre) closely
covered with eoarse, oblong, foveolate punctures, and broadly transversely depressed before the base.
Elytra moderately elongate, subparallel, slightly widening from the base to the rounded posterior angle;
the lateral and apical margins finely serrulate; the apices separately rounded3 each elytron with ten
regular rows of deep, closely-pasked punctures3 the second, fourth, and eighth interspaces, together with
the suture, costate, the second more strongly than the others. Legs short and stout.

Length 2ss lin.
Hah. anco, Xucumanatlan 1n Guerrero (H. H. Smitlz).

One specimen. Not very closely allied to any of the species described by Baly, but
perhaps best placed near 0. subhumeralis. The penultimate joints of the antennae are
closely, but freely, articulated, and strongly transverse.

50 (Α). Chalepus yucatanus. (Tab. X111.fig. 25.)

Moderately elongate, subparallel, subopaque ; black, the prothorax fulvous, with a rather broad black 'or
fuscous median vitta, the elytra with a very broad fulvous lateral pateh extending from the base to beyond
the middle and obliquely truncate behind; the legs and antennae blaok. Head subopaque‚ almost smooth,
the front moderately produced, feebly carinate anteriorly‚ the interocular space longitudinally trisulcate.
Antennae very short, not one third the length of the body, thickening a little outwardly3 the joints cylin-
drioa1‚ 3 much longer than 2 or 4, 4-10 transverse, 11 longer than 10, acuminate. Prothoi-ax opaque,
strongly transverse, a little flat-tened on the disc, transvemely depressed behind, the sides feebly bisinuate
and converging from the base, the anterior angles feebly dentiform; the surface closely covered with deep
foveolato punctures. Elytra rather broad, moderately long, subparallel, slightly widening from the base
