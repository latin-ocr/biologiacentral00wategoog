This ⁴species is apparently rare, as it is not represented in any of the collections from
Central America now before me.

medio, coxis, femoribus basi abdominisque lateribus sordide fulvis3 supra minus nitida, fulva3 macula
verticali‚ antennis (basi picea excepta) scutelloque nigris3 thorace transverso, lateribus basi rectis,
parallelis, vix pone medium angulatis, hinc ad apicem obliquis, disco transversim convexo, basi excavato,
crebre et fortiter punctato‚ nigro trivittato3 elytris pone medium valde explanatis, apice late rotundatis,

γαν. A, Elytrorum vitta nigra obsoleta.

Var. B. Elytris apice plagaque subanehoriformi a basi ad medium extensa, nigris.

Hah. PANAMA, Bugaba 800 to 1500 feet, Galdera in Chiriqui 1200 feet (Champion).

Head rather strongly produced between the eyes, front coarsely punctured; inter-
antennal space with a perpendicular ridge. Antennae half the length of the body, attenu-
ated at the base and apex, robust; the two lower joints cylindrical‚ the third (which is
nearly equal in length to the preceding two united) slightly compressed3 terminal joint
acute, subuncinate. Thorax about one third broader than long3 sides deflexed,
straight and parallel at the base, distinctly angulate just behind the middle, thence
straight and obliquely converging towards the apeX, anterior angle armed with a small
obtuse tooth; above transversely convert, deeply and rather, broadly excavated on the
hinder disc, closely and coarsely punctured3 medial line with a narrow longitudinal
groove; a discoidal vitta, together with one on either side, just within the lateral
margin, black. Scutellum oblongquadrate. Elytra broader than the thorax, dilated
from the base towards the posterior angle, the latter broadly rounded3 apical margin
rounded, conjointly emarginate at the suture3 sut’ural angle armed with a short acute
tooth; lateral margin finely, the apical one more coarsely serrulate3 upper surface
flattened between the humeral calli and also along the anterior two thirds of the suture,
the calli themselves laterally prominent; disc deeply impressed at the base and apex,
and with twelve, in the middle with eleven‚ rows of large round punctures; the third
and sixth interspaces costate; on the lateral margin of the disc, immediately below the
humeral callus, is also a short, third costa; dilated limb closely covered with similar
punctures to those on the disc; at the extreme base, commencing at the scutellum and
extending downwards for about one fourth the length of the elytron, is a narrow
sutural black line, its hinder half bifurcate. Legs‘ slender, elongate; thighs more or
less stained beneath with piceous. ·
