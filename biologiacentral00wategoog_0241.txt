CTENOOHIRA. 225

lent me by M. Rene Oberthiir) to 0. semilobata. The latter differs from the present
insect in the relatively broader elytra and more prominent humeri, and in having the
black dorsal patch more broadly and more deeply emarginate at the sides; the discoidal
patch on the prothorax, too, being parallel at the sides and acutely produced in front
(instead of triangular as in 0. εἰᾶἰί). Boheman's var. a of O. punicea 3, of which there
is a specimen in the Salle collection with his ticket attached, is evidently a pallid
example of 0. ετᾶῖί. We figure a well-marked male example from Teapa.

Of this insect 1 have seen three specimens of the typical form, including the type:
one of these has the scutellum yellow and the elytral punctuation finer. 0. salebram
is based upon a pallid example of the same species; and the var. β, of which four
specimens have been obtained, is probably a small smooth form of it. 0. infantula
closely resembles 0. luqubris, but may be known from it by the single (post-median)
transverse black fascia on the elytral margins, We figure Boheman's types, both
of which are contained in the Baly collection.

⁵ C. bilobata only differs from 0. palmata in having the scutellum and the eighth and
ninth joints of the antennae black, and it cannot be maintained as distinct, these
characters being variable; the single specimen from Oaxaca is intermediate between
the two forms. The species is apparently scarce, one or two specimens only having
been received from each of the localities mentioned. C. palmata is closely allied to
