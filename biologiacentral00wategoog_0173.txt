OHELYMORPHA. 157

We have not received a specimen of this specieS‚ which is a close ally of G. 12-3iynata‚
differing from it in its rufo-testaceous colom, more convex shape, and more coarsely
punctured elytra, each elytron with five large rounded spotS‚ arranged 2, 2, 1.
Boheman's type from the Stockholm Museum is figured.

Hah. MExlco ¹²3, Atlixco (Sulla), Cerro de Plumas, AcapulcO, Tapachula (Hbqe),
Oaxaca (Saue, H oye).

Not uncommon in Oaxaca and at Tapachula. Smaller and more convex than
0. 14-pmwtata3 the elytra a little more coarsely punctured, and with smaller and
fewer spots (at most five on each elytron). In the typical form there are five spots on
each elytron, arranged 2, 2, 1 ; but one or more of these are absent in some specimenS.
In one example from Oaxaca only the humeral spot is present, and in another from the
same locality the five spots are larger than usual. Some of the varieties are scarcely
separable from the var. conjugata of O. 14-pu-7wtata. I have examined one of Bohe-
man's types, a female, which is here figured.

Hah. GUATEMALA 1·3, Capetillo (Chamqn'on, Rodriquez)‚ Zapote (C'Izampion), Escuintla
(Com-adt). ‘

Not uncommon in Guatemala. A species readily recognizable by its glabrous shining
surface‚ above and beneath black3 the elytra each with five rather large spots, and the
prothorax with a large oblong patch on either side of the disc, yellow or reddish·yeHOW.

21. chelymorpha flavomaoulata. (Tab. v11. fig. 18.)

ovate, convex, glabrouS‚ very shining3 black, the prothorax with an oblong rufo-testaceous patch on either
side of the disc extending from the middle to the similarly coloured anterior margin3 the elytra each with
four large orange-yellow patches-—one at the base, transverse, extending from the humeral callus nearly
to the suture, one on the disc before the middle, equally large, rounded or transverse, one below the
shoulder, obovate (half on the disc and half on the margin), and one some distance beyond the middle,
subtriangular‚ extending across the disc nearly to the suture and downwards nearly to the apex, the latter
slightly excised on its outer edge and with a black spot in the centre, or so deeply excised as to form a
>-shaped mark3 the antennae, lege, and under surface black‚ the antennae with the five hasal joints
testaceous beneath. Head rugosa and deeply canaliculate between the eyes, the lower part with a few
scattered punctures3 antennae about reaching the base of the prothorax‚ the five basal joints smooth and
shining. Prothorax convex, twice as broad as long, deeply arcuata-emarginate in front, the sides
arcuately converging from the base, the base deeply emarginate on either side externally, the median lobe
broad and obtuse, the hind angles produced behind; the disc with an abbreviated median groove, sparsely,
finely punctate3 the margins moderately expanded‚ rather coarsely‚ confluently punct-ate, the outer edge
