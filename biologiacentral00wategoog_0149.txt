DOLICHOTOMA.

Dolichotoma‚ Hope, Ann. Nat. Hist. iii. p. 95, t. 4. fig. 2 (1839) 3 Boheman‚ Monogr. Cassid. i.
p. 176.

A Tropical-American genus containing some of the finest species of the Family
Cassididae. The males of all the species of Dolickotoma known to me have the
antennae much longer than in the females‚ the apical joint with numerous very long
projecting hairs at the tip beneath‚ the preceding four joints also with a few shorter
hairs at the same place. The hairy apical joint is mentioned by Boheman‚ though he
was not aware that it was a sexual character ;· it has been overlooked by Chapuis and
Baly. Dolickotoma is chiefly distinguished from Cani-stra, a genus not represented
within our limite, by having the joints 1-6 (instead of 1-5) of the antennae short,

shining‚ and subglabrous‚ the other joints being elongate, opaque‚ and very finely‚
densely pubescent.

Apparently confined to the forest-region of the Atlantic slope of Guatemala, and to
the “ tierra caliente.’'

Hah. GUATEMALA (seltener, in Mus. Brit.); NchRAeuA (coll. Baly 1, Solle), Chon-
tales (Belt, Janson) ; CosrA RloA (Solle, Van Pattcm).

This insect appears to be not uncommon in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The colour
of the upper surface varies from greenish-aeneous to bluish-black or black. The
margins of the elytra are much more broadly expanded than in the allied 1). princeps
and D. biplayiata‚ Boh., and they have 6 large rounded sanguineous patch 6 little
