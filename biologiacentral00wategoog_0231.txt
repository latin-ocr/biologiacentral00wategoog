and the third joint of the antennae shorter. The elytral margins are also differently
coloured—the two fasciae not extending to the outer limb and separated by 8 1011011
1088 elongate flavo-hyaline space; the fasciae are fuscous beneath, paler and more
dilute above. The coloration resembles that of Otenoolzira fraterna, Boh„ and its
811108.

67. coptocycla maculicollis. (Tab.x11.figg.2; 2 a, profile.)

Subrotundate, convex, shining, flavo-testaceous3 the prothorax with various coalescent blaek markings on the
disc, from which a broad sinuous ramus extends across the margins posteriorly3 the elytra with the
disc black, with some spots and longitudinal streaks at the 11880 (including a short curved stripe outside
the 1111100181 callus), and three narrow curved angulated fasciae on the posterior half (the middle one
extending completely across), flavo-testaceous, a very broad black ramus extending across the margins
at the base to the humeri, and the suture also blaek at the tip; the antennae flavo-testaceous, with the
apieal two joints black3 the legs 8011 1101101 81111800 flavo-testaceous, 8 large transverse patch on 1110
metasternum, and the middle of the abdomen at the base, black. Antennae elongate, slender, the apical
five joints a little thicker than those preceding, joint 3 slightly longer 11180 2 and much shorter than 4.
Prothorax twice as broad as long, moderately sinuate at the base 011 either side of the median lobe,
11108111)ν expanded at the sides and in front3 the disc with a few widely scattered fine punctum, very
deeply foveate on either side externally, and deeply foveate in the middle at the base; the margins

times 88 long 88. 1110 prothorax, rather feebly emarginate at the base, with moderately prominent
rounded humeri; the disc very uneven, abruptly transversely gibbous below the base, and deeply
excavate on either side of the suture in front of this, with tows of 008180 deep punctures, which become
finer at the sides and are placed in deep strioe towards the entare, the interstices smooth and here and
there connected by feebly-raised transverse or oblique callosities, the 1111100181 0811118 very prominent;
the margins very broadly expanded, becoming narrow at the apex, deeply transversely excavate and
irregularly foveolate 111 front, subhyaline, reticulate, and somewhat rugulose from 8 little below the base,
and separated from the disc by a row of deep foveoe. Claws angularly dilated at the base.

One specimen. This species approaches C. afferam, Boh.; but it is much 80181101·
and has very different prothoracic and elytral markings, those on the prothorax
extending across the dilated outer margins, the prothorax itself deeply foveate on
either side of the disc externally, the third joint of the antennae shorter‚ &c.

Boheman's description of this species was made from a pallid example, and on
this account the insect is widely separated in his monograph from the allied
0. judaica. In the fully-coloured examples the elytra have a common transverse
fuscous mark before the middle (not mentioned by Boheman), and the disc slightly
