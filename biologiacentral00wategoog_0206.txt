Var. a. The elytra with the disc almost to its outer limit black, stained with ferruginous before the apex, and
sometimes indeterminately ferruginous towards the base.

Coptocycla wesmaeli, var. a, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv. p. 421⁴.

Hah. MExlco 4, Gordova (Saue), Cerro de Plumas (Hbqe); GUATEMALA (Scherzer‚ in
coll. Baly ⁵).

Var. β. The elytra as in α, but with a small oblong spot on the suture a little below the base, and a common
transverse lunate mark about the middle, yellow. (Fig. 7.)

Hah. Mmco, Gerro de Plumas (Ho’qe).

Var. γ. The elytra with the disc castaneous, with a transverse sutural patch before the middle, and the sides
anteriorly, picenae.

Coptocycla puerilis, var. b, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv. p. 447 ⁶.
Hah. anc0, Playa Vicente (Salle ⁶).

Var. δ. The transverse patoh at the base of the prothorax smaller than in the type, and emarginate on either
side in front, sometimes obsolete; the black oblong annulus on the elytra almost obliterated, represented

by a slender longitudinal streak on the outer part of the disc, which only extends to about the middle;
the ante-median sutural spot reduced in size, and sometimes divided at the suture. (Fig. 8.)

Coptocycla puerilis, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv. p. 447 ⁷.
Hah. MExlco, Playa Vicente‚ Cordova, San Andres 'suxtla (Salle), Atoyac in Vera

Gruz (H. H. Smith), Cerro de Plumas, Tapachula (Ηό96); GUATEMALA (coll. Baly ⁷),
Panima in Vera Paz (Champion).

Var. e. The elytra as in δ, but with the sutural spot obsoleto.

Hah. GUA'rnMALA (coll. Baly ⁸).

This variable species has been described under three different names by Boheman‚
0. wesmaeli and Ο. scutiqerula being separated from 0. puerilis by more than one
hundred species in his monograph. The types of all three forms are before me, and
they certainly belong to one and the same specieS. 0. wesmaeli, var. a, Boh., and 0. scuti-
qcrula do not differ in any way from each other3 G. puerilis has the black annulus in
great part obliterated. Some specimens from Misantla and Tapachula are perfectly
intermediate between 0. wesmaeli and 0. puerilia, the annulus being distinctly outlined,
but faint, on the apical half of the elytra. The third joint of the antennae is elongate.
