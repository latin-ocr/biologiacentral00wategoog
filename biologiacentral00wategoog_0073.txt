OHALEPUS. 57

five outer ones forming a slender elongate club. Thorax slightly broader than long;
sides obsoletely angulate, nearly straight and parallel at the base, obliquely converging
before the middle ; disc subcylindrical, closely foveolate-punctate ; the laterai margine,
and also a few of the punctures on either side of the middle disc, black3 a patch just
in front of the scutellum, together with the apical margin, piceous. Elytra oblong,
parallel, obtusely rounded at the apex3 outer margin minutely serrulate‚ the serratures
rather coarser near the hinder angle, the latter rounded ; each elytron with eight, at the
extreme base with nine, rows of large deep punctures ; second, fourth, and sixth inter-
spaces costate, the fifth also elevated at its base 3 nigro-aeneous, a large irregular patch
which extends from the base to beyond the middle, and which covers laterally the
space between the humeral calli, together with some irregular spots on the apical
third of the disc, flavo-fulvouS.

0. distinctus is closely allied in general form and sculpture to 0. inoequalis‚ Weber,
a North-American species.

15. Chalepus breviceps.

Anguste oblongus, ‘postice vix ampliatus, dorso subdeplanatus, nitidus; subtus cum capite rufo-piceus, pectore
nigro-piem, pedibus flavis3 supra pallide flavus3 capite brevi, facie inter oculos vix producta3 thorace
subcylindrico, profunde subcrebre punctat03 lateribus obsoleto angulatis, piceo-tinctis ; elytris oblongis,
parallelis, ad apicem vix ampliatis, minute serrulatis, apice obtuso, obsoleto irregulariter serrulam, angulo
postico distincto, breviter dentat03 disco piceo-oeneo marmorato ; utrisque octo· basi nono—seriato-

punctatis; interspatiis secundo, quarto et sexto, nec non sutura, costatis3 costa externa ante apicem minus
distincte elevata.

Hali. PANAMA, David in Chiriqui (Champion). A single specimen.

Head short, rotundate3 clypeus very short, transverse3 interocular space obso-
letely produced. Antennae robust, equal in length to the head and thorax, the five
outer joints distinctly thickened; eyes piceous. Thorax transverse, subcylindrica13
sides straight and parallel from the base to the middle, thence very slightly converging
towards the apex, armed just behind the latter with a minute tooth‚ the anterior
angle with an oblique obtuse tooth; disc transversely depressed behind, deeply and
somewhat closely punctured. Elytra oblong, slightly dilated towards the posterior
angle3 apices conjointly obtuse, the hinder angle distinct3 sides minutely, the apical
margin obsoletely‚ serrulate 3 posterior angle armed with one or two coarser serratures
than those on the sides3 moderately convex‚ flattened along the suture ; each elytron
with eight, at the extreme base with nine, regular rows of punctures; the second,
fourth, and sixth interspaces, together with the suture, costate; the outer costa less
distinctly raised before its apeX, the apex itself more strongly elevated; apices of
the costae free.

The form of the head will at once separate 0. breviceps from its allieS.
