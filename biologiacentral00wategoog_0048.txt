tatis, utrisque macula parva humerali alteraque discoida1i‚ vix ante medium posita, nigris, aeneo vix
micantibus.

Hah. CosrA R1cA ( Van Patten).—CoLoMB1A 1 (type, coll. Baly).

This species, which probably is as variable as most of its congeners, is appa-
rently rare, only two specimens (the typical one from Colombia and a second from Costa
Rica) being known to me. The specimen from Costa Rica differs from the type in
having the sides of the thorax obliquely converging; in all other respects (except colour)
it agrees with the typical form. Α. perplexus may be at once separated from its allies

by the angular apices and deep punctuation of the elytra.
Owing to this species having been accidentally omitted from Gemminger and Harold’s

Catalogue, Mr. G. O.Waterhouse has since described another insect under the same name.

CEPHALODONTA.
Cephalodonta, Baly, Cat. Hispidae, p. 124, t. 2. f. 15.

Twenty-two species of this genus are described or enumerated below3 of this number
four only were previously known.

Mr. Champion informs me that most of the species are found sitting upon leaves,
some in the dense forest, others in the thinly-wooded savanna country3 they are more
numerous in the “ tierra caliente '’ than at the higher elevations.

1. cephalodonta gemmans. (Cephalodonta qenerosa ⁴⁸, Tab. 11. fig. 14.)

‘Anguste oblonga, convexa, nitida3 subtus nigro-picea aut nigra3 supra viridi-aenea3 capite granuloso, nigro-
aeneo aut amec, facie inferiori antennisque piceo-fulvis, his filiformibus, ad apicem paullo incrassatis,

Hah. GUATEMALA, Cen-0 Zunil 4000 to 5000 feet, Las Mercedes 3000 feet (Cham-
pion).

Head finely granulose, vertex impressed with a deep longitudinal groove3 frent
produced just above the insertion of the antennae into a short triangular plate. Antennae

half the length of the body, filiform, slightly thickened towards the apex; joints cylin-
drieal, the basal one short, submoniliform, second slightly longer, subovate, the third,

ὓ ‘On the Plate the name of this species is wrongly given as oephakdonta yona-osa, a name already employed
by Guerin for a species of the same genus.
