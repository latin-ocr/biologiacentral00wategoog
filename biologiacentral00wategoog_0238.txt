222 PHY'I'OPHAGA.

long as, the prothorax, rather feebly sinuste-emarginate at the base, with prominent subangular humeri3
the disc moderately convex, bifoveate at the base, deeply foveste in the centre before the middle, and
longitudinally depressed towards the sides beyond the middle, with interrupted rows of coarse deep
punctures, the interstices smooth‚ and bere and there transversely connected; the margins broadly
expanded‚ becoming narrow at the apex, smooth and reticulate, hyalino from a little below the base, and

separated from the disc by a row of deep foveae. Claws angularly dilated at the base.
Length 42-5, breadth 335—42} minim.

Hah. Nmuucus, Granada (Salia) ; cosm Rch (colle. Baly and Jamon).

Four specimens. Closely allied to 0. erratica, Boh., but differing from it in the
elytra having a broad castaneous ramus extending from the disc across the margins at
the base. From Ο. siqmfi’ra, Herbst (=quttata, Oliv.), it may be known by its more
triangular shape, and by the coarser punctuation and different markings of the elytra.
The elytra have a transverse subquadrate dark patch across the suture before the
middle, this being larger than in 0. erratica.

CTENOCHIRA.

Coptos-yolo, Sect. 11.‚ Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. iii. p. 430.
Ctemckira, Chapuis, Gen. Col. xi. p. 409 (1875).

This genus, or section of Coptocycla, contains nearly one hundred described species.
It is probably confined to Tropical America‚ ranging as far north as the highlands of
Mexico. Otenoolzira differs from Coptocycla ⁴* in having the claws of the anterior tarsi
angularly dilated, and those of the intermediate and hind tarsi pectinate, at the base.
Neither Boheman nor Chapuis appears to have noticed this, both authors giving the
claws as “ pectinate.'’ Twenty-two species are here enumerated from within our limits,
but some of these are probably not really distinct. Certain groups of species are
indicated, the members of which differ inter se in various details of coloration, e. φτ
(1) 0. plicata, 0. melanota, 0. saqulata, and 0. stac& (2) 0. vivida, 0. tabida, and
C. pumicem and (3) 0. infantula, 0. palmata, and 0. dissimilis. Many of these forms
have been collected together in great abundance by Mr. H. H. Smith at Teapa in
TabascO. The antennae have the third joint short, not longer than the second.
