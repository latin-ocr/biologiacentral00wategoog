OHALEPUS. 49

The head quarters of the genus will be found to be in Tropical America; a few species
inhabit the Southern United States, and one or two are found in the Antilles.

Closely allied to Uroplala; the species, as a mle, are more simple in form than those of
that genus3 the antennae, with a few exceptions, are filiform or subfiliform‚ and their
joints are more or less cylindrica13 the apices os the elytra are more regularly rounded‚
the posterior angle of the latter being rarely produced.

Below is a table of the species :—
