30 PHYTOPHAGA.

subsulcatis3 rufo-fulvis, plaga magna ovata, communi, a paullo infra basin ad longe pone medium extensa,
Inuenifffinornatim pedibus anticis in utroque sexu inermibus.

Hah. NICARAGUA, Chontales (Belt) ; PANAMA, Bugaba (Champion).

Face between the antennae with a longitudinal ridge‚ its lower half usually produced
into a recurved horn, the apex of which is sometimes dilated and truncate. Antennae
filiform‚ slightly thickened towards the apex, third joint nearly equal in length to the
preceding two united. Thorax broader than long3 sides nearly straight and parallel,
usually slightly angulate in the middle, rounded and converging towards the apex; disc
smooth, punctate on the sides. Elytra oblong, conve1‚ the humeral callus laterally
prominent, but not compressed as in 0. distinam surface regularly punctate-striate,
the striae on the sides and at the apex sulcate. Anterior pair of legs simple.

2. cheirispa distincta. (Tab.11.fig. 9.)

Anguste oblonga, convexa, subtus nigra, nitida, thorace piceo; supra picea; antennis nigris3 thorace laevi, ad
latera sparse punctato; elytris oblongis, regulariter punctato-striatis, striis ad latera et ad apicem sulcatis,
pallide piceis, plaga magna, male definita, a basi ad pone medium extensa, picea.

Mas. Antennis basi approximatis, cornu faciali nullo; femoribus anticis subtus spina acuta armatis3 tibiis

’ curvatis, extus infra basin tuberculo parvo armatis, apice valde incrassatis.

Fam. Femoribus anticis inermibus, tibiis ad apicem minus incrassatis.

Var. A. Tibiis anticis pallide piceis.

Var. B. Pallide piceo-fulva, antennis extrorsum nigris.

Long. 23 lin.

Hah. ΡΑΝΔΜΑ, Bugaba 800 to 1500 feet, Volcan de Chiriqui 2000 to 6000 feet
(OEampion).

Vertex and front impunctate, the latter impressed with a longitudinal groove3 lower
face unarmed. Antennae more than half the length of the body, filiform, very slightly
thickened towards the apex; the third joint slender, equal in length to the pre·
ceding two. Thorax broader than long3 sides sinuate and parallel from the base to
beyond the middle, thence rounded and converging to the apex; disc convex‚ smooth
and shining, sparingly punctured on the sides. Elytra oblong, convex‚ slightly flattened
along the anterior two thirds of the suture, humeral callus compressed laterally into a
short ridge3 surface regularly punctate·striate, the striae sulcate on the sides and at the
apex; interspaces (with the exception of those on the anterior portion of the inner disc)
thickened and more or less costate. Anterior thighs in the male thickened, armed

beneath with an acute spine.
Both this and the preceding species agree closely in coloration with those characterized

in the ‘ Catalogue of Hispidae.’ 0. distincta differs, however, in the absence of the
frontal horn, and G. dor-sata in having the anterior pair of thighs unarmed.
