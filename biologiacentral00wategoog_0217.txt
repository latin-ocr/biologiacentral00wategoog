COPTOCYCLA. 201

35. Coptocycla irazuensis. (Tab. IX. fig. 4.)

Broad ovate, moderately convex‚ dilute flamus, shining, the margins hyalino ; the eyeS‚ and a narrow trans-
verse patch (rounded anteriorly) at the base of the prothorax‚ black; the scutellum black‚ sanguineous at
the tip ; the elytra with a moderately broad, oblong black annulus on the outer part of the dise, extending to
beyond the middle and rounded behind, bordered internally and externally with sanguineous, and enclosing
a large, oval, common flavous patch; the antennae flavous‚ the apieal joint infuscate at the tip3 the legs
and under sui-face flavous. Antennae moderately long, slender, the apical five joints a little thiokened,
joint 3 scarcely longer than 2. Prothorax twice as broad as long, broadly expanded and reticulate at
the sides and in frent, the diso canaliculato and with a few very minute soattered punctures behind.
Elytra about three times as long as the prothorax, and much wider than it, deeply emarginate at the
base, with prominent, rather sharp humeri3 the disc moderately convex‚ hollowed at the sides behind the
humeral callus and foveate before the middle, wit-h a feebly impressed sutural stria posteriorly‚ somewhat
closely seriate-punctate—the punctures fine towards the suture and coarse at the sides,—the flavous
apical portion almost impunctate‚ the interstices smooth and flat3 the margins broadly expanded,
becoming gradually narrower towards the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row
of moderately deep foveoe. Olaws simple.

Length 53, breadth 43 minim.

One specimen, probably of the female sex, Closely allied to 0. ambita, but a little
smaller and narrower 3 the annulus narrower, and rounded at the apex, rather broadly
bordered on the inner side with sanguineous, and with the outer edge and a spot on
the humeral callus also sanguineouS, and enclosing a large, ‘oval, flavous patch.

(Blancaneauoe); N1cARAeuA‚ Chontales (Belt, Jamon); CosrA R1cA (Sallen Pium,
Bugaba, David (Clzampion).

This species is not uncommon at Teapa. The antennae are rather short, extending
to very little beyond the base of the prothorax; the third joint is short and slender,
not longer than the second. The South-American 0. myop3‚ Boh., is a very close ally
of this insect. A specimen from Teapa is figured.

Zapote, San Geronimo (Champion).

In the single specimen from Presidio, apparently fully mature, the narrow annulus
(common to the prothorax and elytra) is interrupted and indistinct, and ferruginous
instead of black. The antennae are rather short, with the third joint slender and not
