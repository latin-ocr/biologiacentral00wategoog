1. Charidotis pustulata. (Tab. IX. fig. 19.)

Short ovate, very convex, shining; dilute flavous, the expanded margins subhyaline, the prothorax with a
narrow transverse patch at the base, widened at the middle, and the scutellum, sanguineous ; the elytra
with the disc sanguineous, except a common transverse patoh before the middle (widening posteriorly)‚ a
transverse fascia at about one-third from the apex (widening outwardly), and the sides, which are
flavous3 the antennoe pale testaceous, the apical joint fuscous3 the legs and underside testaceous.
Antennae short, not extending beyond the base of the prothorax, joint 3 very short, much shorter than,
and not nearly so stout as, 2, 4 considerably longer than 3, 5 and 6 equal, each longer than 4, 7-11
stout, 8-10 as broad as long, 11 nearly twice as long as 10, acuminato. Prothorax broadly expanded
at the sides and in front3 the disc deeply obliquely grooved at the base on either side of the very
broadly truncated median lobe, finely canaliculato in the middle behind; the surface smooth, the
margins reticulate. Scutellum very large, smooth. Elytra a little wider than the prothorax at the base,
deeply sinuate-emarginate in front, and with prominent subaugular humeri3 the disc very convex‚
bifoveate at the base, hollowed behind the prominent humeral callus, and abruptly declivous at the sideS,
with rows of very coarse deep punctures‚ interrupted by two large, transverse, smooth callosiffies· -one
before the middle, with a ramus extending outwards‚ the other in the form of a fascia at one-third from
the apex,—the outer portion also smooth, the interstices narrow, smooth, and irregularly raised3 the
margins rather broadly expanded, becoming very narrow at the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated
from the disc by a row of distantly placed foveae.

Length 4ξ-5, breadth 4 millim.

(Champion ).·

Four specimens. Allied to C. cinctella, Boh., from Brazil, but with much larger

flavous callosities on the elytra, the posterior one forming a transverse fascia, the outer
portion of the disc smooth.
