This is a common insect in Central America. It varies greatly in size, and also in
the colour of ‘the antennae, and of the under surface, the elytral markingS, t00‚ are
sometimes obliterated. With the types of Boheman’s insects before me, I am unable
to distinguish more than one variable specieS. Ο. meticulosa was Α based upon a
discoloured male example of 0. erratica, with the apical five joints of the antennae
apparently G) infuscate3 the characteristic transverse ferruginous spot on the suture
before the middle is very distinct in the type, though it is not mentioned by Boheman.
0. varioornis (the type of which is contained in the British Museum) has the elytral
markings obliterated and the abdomen entirely testaceous, characters of no importance
when a long series of specimens is examined3 it has been received from a number of
localities in company with 0. erratica. The elytra usually have an indeterminate vitta
on the outer part of the disc—extending from a little in front of the humeral callus to
beyond the middle and then curving inwards to the suture,—and a common transverse
spot on the suture before the middle, ferruginous or fuscouS‚ the rather coarse,
scattered, subserially arranged punctures being similarly coloured. The antennae are
testaceous, and usually have the ninth and tenth joints, and sometimes the eighth als0,
infuscate3 but in some specimens (from Chiriqui) they are almost entirely testaceouS,
and in others the apical joint is infuscate, except at the tip3 the third joint is a little
longer than the second, and shorter than the fourth. Several os the Chiriqui examples
are unusually large, otherS, again, from Teapa are small, the species varying considerably
in this respect. In some specimens the elytra are subseriately punctured to the apex;
the transverse sutural spot is nearly always distinct, even in the variety van'corm's.
We figure a male example from Tuxtla.

79. coptooyola angularis. (Tab.X11.fig.15‚e.)

&nadad-triangular, moderately convex, flavo-testaceous3 the prothorax with an indistinct oblong dilute
fuscous or castaneous patch on the middle of the disc behind, this being exeised in front3 the elytra with
a common transverse subquadrate patch across the sutura before, and an irregular fascia beyond the
middle, some irregular markingt-J, the puncturee, and a broad ramus on the margin at the base extending
from the disc outwards, dilute castaneous or fuscous3 the antennoe flavo-testaceous‚ with the ninth and
tenth joints more or less infuscate3 the legs flavo-testaceous3 the body beneath black, marked with
yellow at the sides, the abdomen with the sides and apex broadly flavo-testaceous. Antennoe moderately
long, slender‚ the apical five joints a little thickened‚ joint 3 short, not longer than 2. Prothorax nearly
twice as broad as long, rather feebly sinuate at the base on either side of the median lohe, broadly
expanded at the sides and in frent, smooth ; the disc obliquely grooved on either side of the median lobe
behind; the margins hyaline and reticulate. Elytra very much wider than, and about three times as
