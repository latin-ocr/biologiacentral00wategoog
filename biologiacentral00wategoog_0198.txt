182 PHYTOPHAGA.

There is a Mexican specimen of this species in the British Museum from the
Chevrolat collection, no doubt the type, and another in the Baly collection. We
also have two of it from Guatemala—one with the elytra entirely black, the other with
the elynal margins narrowly bordered with yellow at the base and apex, Boheman
describes the elytra as black, with the shoulders narrowly margined with yellovv. The
south-American 0. flama, Boh.‚ is a closely allied form.

A very distinct species, easily known by its opaque, bluish·black upper surface‚ the
prothorax with the anterior margin fiavous and hyaline.

Boheman in his subsequent publications ² 3 omits the locality “ Brazil ’⁹ altogether;
it is, however, more likely to be correct than ‘ Mexioo,” as the allied forms are all

Brazilian.

No less than 376 species were included under Coptocycla, Sect. 1., by Boheman ; the
remainder (93), belonging to his Section 11.. have the four hinder claws pectinate‚ and
these have been separated by Chapuis under the generic name Otenochz‘ra. Of the 376
species of Sect. Ι. it is probable that a very large number of the American species belong
to GMw-ida, though two only (G. cruciata, Linn.‚ and 0. elatior, Boh.‚ both from Tropical
South America) were referred to it by Chapuis. Those species with the claws angu-
larly dilated at the base belong to Chirida, and those with the claws simple to
Coptocycla. The name Clzirz'cla will probably have to be adopted eventually, but it is
not advisable to use it at present, as some of the species placed in Cassida by Boheman
also have the claws angularly dilated ³³. Next to the form of the claws, the relative
length of the third joint of the antennae seems to afford a valuable character for
grouping the large number of species of this genus, though it was not used by

Boheman.
