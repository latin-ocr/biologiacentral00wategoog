CHELYMORPHA.—SELENIS. 159

24. chelymorpha obliterata. (Ταῦ. VII. fig. 21, 9 .)

Subrotundate ( <5 )‚ ovate ( ῼ ), convert, glabrous, shining3 rufo-testaceous or testaceous‚ the head, the prothorax
with a median vitta behind. (usually extending narrowly forwards to the apex) and sometimes the sides
broadly from the middle to the base, and the scutellum, black; the elytra with the suture for a short
distance below the scutellum, the entire exterior limb, a small spot on the humeral callus, and sometimes
a similar spot in a line with it about the middle, in one example with two other very small spots
plaoed one behind the other nearer the suture (the anterior one nearly in a line with the median spot,
when present), black 3 the antennae and legs, the exterior limb of the elytra rather broadly‚ and the under
surface of the body black‚ the antennae with the four or five basal joints rufo-testaceous beneath. Head
rugosely punctured and canaliculato between the eyes, the lower part with a few scattered puncturas ;
antennae about reaching the base of the prothorax, the five basal joints smooth and shining. Prothorax
convert, twice as broad as long, arcuate-emarginate in front, the sides rounded from the base and rapidly
converging from the middle forwards, the base deeply emarginate on either side externally‚ the median
lobe broad and obtuse, the hind angles sharp and produced behind ; the disc with an interrupted faint
median groove‚ sparsely‚ minutely punctate3 the margins moderately expandam concave, coarsely‚ eon-
fluently punctured‚ the outer edge very narrowly reflexed. Scutellum smooth. Elytra regularly convex,
in the ὁ· about three, in the Ω more than four times as long as the prothorax‚ and wider than it at the
base, rounded at the sides anteriorly‚ widest before the middle, the humeri rounded ; the margins rather
broadly expanded and deflexed ; the entire surface thickly, rather coarsely punctate. Beneath almost
glabrous‚ smooth‚ the metapleurae with scattered coarse punctures ; prosternam very deeply sulcate poste·
riorly. Claws appendiculate.

Length, ό ῼ , 9-103, breadth ’7-8 minim.

Hah. GUATEMALA, Tactic in Vera Paz (Conradt)‚ San Geronimo in Vera Paz
(Champion).
A pair from Tactic and a female from San GeronimO. This insect closely resembles

Boheman's var. e of the Mexican 0. juvenem but may easily be known from it by the

entirely glabrous upper surface. It is more nearly allied to 0. qvattzfera, 0. epilach-
uoidoe, διο. The species is probably a variable one.

SELENIS.
Selenis, Hope, Ann. Nat. Hist. iii. p. 96, t. 4. fig. 3 (1839) 3 Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 94.

A Tropical=American genus containing four described specie& one of which occurs
within our limits, remarkable from having the humeral angles of the elytra acutely
prolonged forwards in the male sert, the elytra themselves often perforated.

1. Selenis sparsa. (Tab. v11. figg. 22ss ; 23, 2 .)

Found in abundance by myself on low plants on the river-banks at David. The
localities “ Mexico ” and “ Bolivia '’ require confirmation; both are probably given in
mistake by Boheman 1, the second not being quoted by him in his subsequent workS.
