0. incincta has comparatively short, subfiliform antennae, with joint 3 shorter and
thinner than 2, 4 fully twice as long as 3, 5-10 slightly decreasing in length. The
deep punctures on the elytra are rather widely separated from each other, especially
on the rounded black patch enclosed by the yellow annulus.

Hah. Pium, Volcan de Chiriqui (Ohampicm).—BRA21L 1, Rio Grande 2 3.

Three male examples from Chiriqui, agreeing with others from Brazil. No mention
is made by Boheman of the sexual differences, the males having, as in some of the
allied formS, the elytra very obtuse and almost separately rounded at the apex. The
antennae are moderately elongate and subfiliform, with joint 3 much shorter and
thinner than 2, 4 twice as long as 3, 5 nearly twice as long as 4, 6-10 subequal in
length, 11 very elongate, black at the tip.

Var. β. The elytral fascia extending forwerds along the first and second interstices to the base, leaving a large
rounded patch on each elytron, and nearly the apical half, black3 antennae with joints 4-6 and 11 infuscatae
at the tip beneath.

0. fcihroez‘, the type ( ῼ) of which we figure (fig. 16), is evidently only a variety of
the widely distributed 0. aurofasciata. The males, as in the closely-allied 0. leprieun‘,
Boh., differ from the females in having the elytra broadly subtruncate at the apex.
The antennae are elongate and subfiliform‚ with the third joint (as in G. leprieun‘)
distinctly shorter and thinner than the second, the fourth twice as long as the third,
the fifth more than one-half longer than the fourth, joints 5-10 being elongate and
subequal in length.
