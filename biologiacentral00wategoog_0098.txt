longer, its apex subacute. Thorax transverse, about one third broader than long at the
base; sides slightly rounded and converging from the base to the apex, the anterior angle
with a short lateral tubercle; basal margin deeply excavated on either side the medial
lobe; transversely convex, rather deeply excavated transversely on the hinder disc
immediately in front of the basal lobe; surface covered with large foveae, shallow on
the sides, more deeply impressed on the disc. Elytra subelongate‚ strongly lobed at
the base, parallel, very feebly dilated towards the apex, the latter entire, and regularly
rounded3 lateral margin finely, its hinder third, together with the apical border, rather
coarsely, serrulate; above convex on the sides, flattened along the suture; each elytron

 

with ten, at the extreme base with eleven, regular rows of large deep punctures‚ the ,

second interspace strongly, the eighth, together with the extreme apex of the fourth
and the basal fourth of the sixth‚ moderately costate; each elytron with an irregular

fulvous patch, covering the humeral callus, and extending downwards from the base
nearly to the middle of the disc.

Interocular space very strongly produced, opaque‚ its hinder half faintly grooved on
either side, its anterior portion obscure fulvous‚ its medial line with a slightly raised
longitudinal ridge. Antennae half the length of the body, compressed, tapering from the
sixth joint to the apex 3 the third joint to the ninth cristate in the male, less distinctly
so in the female ; two lower joints short, equal, the first thickened, submoniliform, the
second subovate, the third subcordate‚ and equal in length to the preceding tWO, the
fourth and following ones to the tenth nearly equal in length, each distinctly shorter
than the third. Thorax rather broader than long at the base, conic; sides notched just
in front of the posterior angle, slightly but distinctly angulate just beyond the middle,
thence obliquely converging to the apex, the anterior angle armed with an obtuse lateral
tooth; above opaque‚ the sides abruptly deflexed, coarsely foveolate-punctate, the disc
depressed‚ its hinder half broadly excavated3 surface opaque‚ irregularly and feebly
foveolatffipunctate, the medial line with a faintly impressed narrow longitudinal groove3
