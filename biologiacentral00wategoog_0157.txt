MESOMPHA LIA. 141

and a very large subtriangular pat-ch on the disc a little beyond the middle, the latter connected externally
with an equally large slightly eun-ed antemedian lateral pateh, these markings not reaching the sutural
or lateral margins, yellow: antennae and legs black, the joints 1-3 of the antennae narrowly fulvous at
the tip: beneath black‚ shining. Head rugosely punctured‚ opaque‚ deeply canaliculat03 antennae with
the four basal joints shining, the others opeque. Prothorax subopaque, twice as broad 66 long, deeply
arcuate-emarginate in front, the sides rapidly arcuately converging from the base, somewbat obliquely so
towards the anterior angles, the base subtruncate on either side, the median lobe obtuse and moderately
produced, the disc with a fine, smooth median line, the surface sparsely, very minutely punctured.
Scutellum smooth. Elytra more than three times the length of, and one half wider than, the prothorax,
broadly subeordate‚ conjointly rounded at the apex; the disc moderately shining, regularly convex. thickly,
finely punctured‚ the suture a little raised posteriorly‚ smooth ς 1116 margins very broadly expanded
anteriorly, more narrowly so posteriorly, somewhat obliquely rounded at the shoulders, the median patch
shining, more closely puncturcd than the disc, the other part opeque, minutely punctured, the exterior
limb slightly thickened and reflexed. Beneath subglabrous‚ almost smooth, shining.
Length 12, breadth 10 minim.

Hah. GUATEMALA, San J uan in Vera Paz (Champion).

One example. Exceedingly close to M. salvini, but with very different elytral
markingS, the disc of the elytra a little more uniformly punctured.

8. Mesomphalia quadriguttata. (Tab. VI. fig. 6, 9. .)

ῼ . Broad ovate, moderately convex; greenish·aeneou8‚ the anterior margins of the prothorax (except in the
middle) fulvous; the elytra each with a large, oval‚ oblique patch on the disc at the base, and a very
broad oblique patch a little before the middle, extending from the middle of the disc almost to the
lateral margin, yellow 3 tho antennae black, joints 2-4 testaceous beneath; legs and under sur-face bluish-
black, the pro- and epipleurae (the median spot excepted) caeruleous, Head opaque, rugulosely punctured.
deeply canaliculat03 antennae with the four 116661 joints shining, the others opeque. Prothorux opeque,
twice as broad as long, rather deeply arcuato-emarginate in front‚ the sides rapidly arcuately converging
from the base, the base subtruncate on either side, the median lobe obtuse and somewhat broadly produced,
the disc with a smooth, fine, impressed median line, becoming deeper behind, the surface with very
minute, shallow, scattered punctures. Scutellum smooth. Elytra about three and a half times the
length of, and at the base not wider than, the prothorax‚ broad oval, eonjointly rounded at the apex ; the
disc moderately shining to beyond the middle, opaque at the apex, regularly convex, thickly, finely
punctured‚ the punctures a little coarser and more irregular on the light-coloured parts, the suture
smooth, not raised posteriorly3 the margins moderately expanded, deflexed, obliquely converging
anteriorly, widest at about one-fourth from the base, punctured like the dise, opaque, the median
patch slightly shining, the exterior limb scarcely thickened. Beneath shining, very sparsely pubescent‚
almost smooth.

Length 10, breadth 8 millim.

Hab. NIOARAGUA‚ Chontales (Belt).

One example. Closely allied to M. salvini and M. xanthospila‚ but with different
elytral markings; the elytra ( ῼ ) much less broadly expanded at the sideS, at the base
not wider than the base of the prothorax, the margins punctured like the disc.
