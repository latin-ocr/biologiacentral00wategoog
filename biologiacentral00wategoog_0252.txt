236 APPENDIX.

Two specimens, This species is allied to 0. suturalia, Baly, from which it differs,
apart from colour, in the strongly costate elytra‚ the apices of which are more distinctly
emarginate at the sutural angle, and in the longer third joint of the antennae. The
apical four joints of the antennae are almost fused into a single piece, and the species
would therefore (like C. suturalia) be almost as well placed in Uroplata. An insect

from Guatemala labelled doubtfully by Baly as Uroplata subvirem, Chap., is perhaps a
still more nearly allied form.

Chalepus suturalis (pp. 51, 120).

To the localities given, add 2— MEXICO, Chilpancingo and Amula in Guerrero
(H. H. Smitlz).

Three exampleS. In this insect the apical four joints of the antennae are extremely
closely articulated, a character not mentioned by Baly. ⁵

Chalepus placidus (p. 52).
To the localities given, add t—MEXICO, Teapa in T abasco (H. H. sz‘th).

F our exampleS.

Ghalepus saundorsi (p. 53).
To the localities given, add z—anco, Teapa in Tabasco (Η. H. Smitlz).

Three example& This insect is probably a pale variety of C. terminatus.

Chalepus terminatus (p. 54).
To the localities given, add :—MExlco, Teapa in T abasco (II. Η. Smiclz).

Numerous exampleS. As in O. saundersi, specimens occur with a short additional
row of punctures (between the first and second) at the apex of the elytra.

Chalopus pallescens (p. 56).

To the localities given„add :—M1··:xlco, Chilpancingo and R. Papagaio in Guerrer0‚
Atoyac in Vera Cruz, Teapa in Tabasco (H. H. Smitlz).

A single specimen from each locality. C. jansoni, Baly, from Chontales, is probably
an immaculate variety of the same specieS, the type of which was obtained at Bugaba.

Chalepus distinctus (p. 56).
'l'o the localities given, add 2—MEX1c0, J alapa (Ηόρθ), Atoyac in Vera CruZ, Teapa
in Tabasco (Η. Η. Smith).
