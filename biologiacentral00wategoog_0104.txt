88 PHYToPHAeA.

sides in the male straight and diverging from the base to some distance beyond the
middle, thence abruptly converging to the apex: nearly parallel posteriorly, then
converging and sinuate from immediately above the middle towards the apex in the·
female, the anterior angle in both sexes armed with a stout subacute tooth ; upper surface
rugose·punctate‚ an irregular vitta on the sideS, together with four longer depressions
on the disc, black, the two anterior depressions transverse, often confluent, and in some
specimens concolorous with the general surface of the thorax. Scutellum subquadrate.
Elytra narrowly oblong, slightly increasing in width towards the posterior angle, the
latter distinct in both sexes, abruptly dilated laterally in the male; the lateral margin
armed with a number of short acute teeth, the apical margin obtusely rounded, more
coarsely serrate ; upper surface finely seriate-punctate; each elytron with a number of
strongly raised ridges, which anastomose‚ and form an irregular network over the
surface; on the middle disc and again at the apex near the suture, they are more
strongly elevated than on the other portions of the surface.

Hah. GUATEMALA, Capetillo (Champion). A single specimen.

Vertex opaque, minutely granulose, and, together with the antennal club, black.
Thorax nearly twice as broad as long; sides rounded, more quickly converging ante-
riorly, the anterior angle produced into a stout, subacute, slightly excurved tooth ;
surface transversely convex, strongly and deeply punctured on the sides, more closely
and rather less strongly punctured on the middle disc; hinder disc broadly excavated
on either side, the anterior disc with faint traces of two similar excavations. Elytra
oblong, slightly dilated posteriorly3 sides serrate, sinuate' just before reaching the
posterior angle, the latter broadly dilated laterally, coarsely serrate; upper suriace

sculptured as in 0. scabm'pennis.
Separated from the above-named species by its broader thorax and by the much more

broadly dilated posterior angles of the elytra—in other respects very similar.
