PIIYSONOTA. 169

Ρ. attenuata. The prothorax is described as having numerous irregularly confluent
black markings3 but these may be partly due to discoloration.

With the types os these two insects before me, I am quite unable to separate them
as distinct species; P. impromta merely differs from P. picticollis in having an in-
distinct spot on either side of the median lobe of the prothorax at the base (often
obsolete)‚ and the elytra a little more closely punctured. Boheman appears only to
have seen female specimens ; the male has the elytra broader (at the base considerably
wider than the prothorax) and shorter, with the humeri broadly rounded. We have
received numerous examples of both sexes from VentanaS, in Western Mexico.

The specimens from Northern Mexico, and also the one from J alapa, belong to the
var. b of Boheman 1, which has two small spots on the prothorax on either side of the
disc midway between the short median streak and the outer margin. The specimen
from Totosinapan belongs to the var. a, which has only one spot on either side of the
disc ; and the example from Sturm's collection agrees with the type, which has a short
median streak only on the prothoraX. The specimen figured represents one of Bohe-
man’s types of the var. a.

Hah. Mssxtco 1-3‚ J uquila (Sane).
Of this species I have only seen two specimens of the var. a described by Boheman 2;

one of these is shown on our Plate. The elytra have irregular rows of rather coarse
blackish punctures on the disc, the margins coarsely‚ irregularly punctate.
