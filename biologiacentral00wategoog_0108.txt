The fulvous markings both of the thorax and of the elytra apparently vary greatly
in this species. I have only given the principal forms of coloration above, but inter·
mediate grades exist. M. rubrolineata is very closely allied to M. (verme, Newman,
but may be known by its smaller size and narrower and more conical thorax3 the
serratures also on the outer margin of the elytra are nearly obsolete in the latter

species.

UROPLATA.

Uroplata, Guerin, Icon. du Regne Ann. iii. Texte, p. 274 3 Bady, Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. 3rd
ser. xiv. p. 335 (1864).

Uroplata is closely allied to θ’]ιαῖεμω, being only separated from that genus by the
soldering together of the four upper joints of the antennae. As a rule the insects
belonging to the two genera can be readily separated3 but in certain species of
Chalepus (morio and its allies) several of the upper joints are so closely articulated
with each other, and at the same time so densely clothed with adpressed hairs, that it
requires a close examination to ascertain whether they are distinct or consolidated
w th each other.

Uroplata, taken as a whole, is more heterogeneous than Ohalepus in the form both
of its antennae and of its elytra3 it probably, next to the latter genus, is also more
numerous in species than any other (with perhaps the exception of Hispa proper) in
the family.

The species are found in Central and South America; none, so far as my knowledge
extends, occurring in the United States or in any other part of North America; the
insects placed by Von Harold in his Catalogue as inhabiting the northern continent
belong to the genus Okalepus.
