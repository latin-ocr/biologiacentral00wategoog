PORPHYRASPIS.
Pcmhyraspis, Hope, Col. Man. iii. p. 154- (1840) 3 Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. i. p. 89.

Twenty species of this peculiar genus have been described, all but one from 'l'ropical
South America or the Antilles, the latter, P. cyanea, Say (= erythrocera, Germ),
being from the Southern States of North America. No representative of the genus
has been discovered as yet in MexicO. The sculpture of the elytra in some of the
species is very like that of Clilamys, and it is difficult to describe in an intelligible

manner. Three species of Porphyraspis are now recorded from within our limits‚ two
from the State of Panama and one from Guatemala.

a. Elytra feebly and reqularly costate on the disc.

Numerous exampleS.

b. Elytra with shavply raised, irreqular, transversely connected
costoe on the disc.

2. Porphyraspis flexuosa. (Ταῦ. v. fig. 11.)

Rotundate, short, very convex, obscure sanguineum, shining‚ the anterior angles of the prothorax yellowish3
the antennae, legs, and under surface testaceous. Head almost smooth‚ canaliculato in the middle in
front3 antennae short, only extending a little beyond the humeri, rather stout, considerably thickened
towards the tip. Prothorax short, broadly and deeply emarginate in fmnt, and moderately dilated at
the sides; the sides rounded, abruptly and subarcuately converging anteriorly3 the anterior angles
rather sharp3 the disc moderately convex, strongly transversely depressed before the middle, obliquely
grooved on either side behind, and with an interrupted median channel, sparsely, irregularly‚ rather
coarsely punctured in front- and on either side at the base; the lateral portione deeply excavato,
exceedingly coarsely punctured. Scutellum almost smooth. Elytra very much wider than the prothorax,
short, rounded at the sides, widest at the middle, deeply emarginate in front, obtuse behind, the humeri
prominent and somewhat dentiform ; the disc gibbous, with irregular close series of coesse, deep, partly
confluent impressione, and a smooth, prominent humeral callus, between which and the suture are two
sharply raised carinae, these extending downwards nearly to the apex and here and there connected with
each other, and with the sharply raised sutnre before the middle, by oblique or transverse rami, the
other interspaces more or less transversely plicate; the margins moderately expanded‚ with a double
series of exceedingly coarse rounded foveae‚ the interspaces irregularly transversely plicato. Beneath
mining, almost smooth.

One specimen from each locality. A small species allied to P. cyclica, Boh., from

Guiana, and P. reticulata, Wag., from S. America. It is much smaller than P. cyclica,
and has the disc of the prothorax more uneven and the carinae on the elytra more
