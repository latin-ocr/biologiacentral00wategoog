Var. 'I'he second discoidal spot and the two outer median ones coalescent, so as to form an irregular fascia on

each elytrom the first and second discoidal spots often united with the sutural one, forming a common
χ -shaped patch. (Fig. 25.)

This species is confined to the Atlantic slope. With the type of 0. 17-n0tata‚ Boh.,
before me, I am unable to separate it from Ο. comata, even as a variety; it merely
differs from 0. comata in having the elytral spots larger, the common sutural patch
sometimes continued downwards and coalescent on either side with the second discoidal
spot. C. smithi is a local variety, not uncommon in Tabasc0‚ where also the var. 17-
notata occurs; these two forms were also collected together at Rio Hondo and Chiacam.
Boheman ⁷ compares 0. amithi with 0. catenulatcm the latter, however, has the elytra
much flatter, not at all gibbous below the base. We figure a variety ( ῼ ) from Vera
Cruz ; one of Boheman’s types ( ὃ) of C. 17-ηοταία, from Playa Vicente‚ and one ( ὅ)
of his G. smithi from Teapa.

Α species readily recognizable by its rufo-testaceous or rufous elytra and black pro·
thorax„ the latter with the anterior margin, and sometimes a narrow streak on the
disc, rufo-testaceous.

Not uncommon in Chiriqui. All our specimens, and also those named by Boheman
in the National Collection, have a small black spot on either side of the disc of the
prothorax about the middle. Some examples have a broad indeterminate flavous
