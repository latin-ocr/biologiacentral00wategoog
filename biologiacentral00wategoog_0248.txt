PHYTOPHAGA.

21. ctenoohira crux-flava. (rab. x111. fig. 20, a .)

Subrotundate‚ very convex, shining‚ dilute flavous or flavo-testaceous, the margins subhyalinc; the prothorax
with the entire disc black3 the elytra with the diso nearly to the apex black, marked with a common,
broad, cruciform, flavous patrib—extending from the base to a little beyond the middle, and laterally with
a transverse ramus extending from it to the margins‚—-formed by smooth, raised, irregular reticulations;
the antennae, lege, and under surface entirely flavous or flavo-testaceous. Antennae elongate, joints 3-6
slender, 7-11 slightly thickened‚ 3 a little shorter than 2, 4 nearly twice as long as 3, 4-6 equal in length,
7-10 more elongate, 11 nearly twice as long as 10, acuminato. Prothorax about twice as broad as long,
broadly expanded and reticulate at the sides and in front, sinuate at the base on either side of the broad
median lobe; the disc smooth, foveate and with a few scattered puncturas at the sides behind, grooved on
either side of the median lobe. Elytra very much wider than, and nearly three times as long as, the
prothorax, deeply sinuate-emarginate at the base, and with prominent obtuse humeri; the disc very con-
vex, feebly transversely gibbous below the base, hollowed at the sides behind the humeral callus, deeply
excavate and foveate within the basal margin, and deeply foveate near the suture below the base, with
rows of rather coarse deep punctures extending to the apex, the rows interrupted by t-he strongly raised
reticulations forming the common cruciform patch ; the margins very broadly expanded, becoming narrow
at the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of deep foveoe. Anterior tarsal
claws angularly dilated ; the intermediate and hind tarsal claws pectinata.

Length 6ὲ-7, breadth 53-62} millim.

Hah. PANAMA‚ Ragaba, Volcan de Chiriqui (Oltampion).

Numerous exampleS. Not closely allied to any species described by Boheman3 it is
perhaps best placed near 0. conscripta.

22. ctenoohira aspersa. (16611111. fig. 21, 6 .)

Rotundate, convex‚ shining‚ flavous or flavo-testaceous, the margins hyaline ; the prothorax with a short
median line at the base, 6 short oblique 1166 midway between this and the outer limit of the disc, and
sometimes a small spot or curved mark between these, fuscous or dilute fuscous3 the elytra with a short
fine curved line on the humeral callus and the punctures fuscous ; the antennae flavous, sometimes with
the ninth joint infuscate3 the legs 6611 under surface flavo-testaceous. Antennae elongate, joints 3-6
slender, 7 -11 slightly thickened, 3 a little shorter than 2, 4 nearly twice as long as 3, 4-6 equal in length,
7-10 more elongato, 11 nearly twice as long as 10, acuminate. Prothorax about twice 66 broad as long,
broadly expanded and reticulate at the sides and 16 front, 61611616 at the base on either side of the median
lobe; the disc smooth, foveate and with a few scattered punctures at the sides behind, and grooved on
either side of the median lobe. Elytra very much wider than, and in the female three times as long as,
the prothorax‚ shorter in the male, somewhat deeply sinuata-emarginate at the base, with prominent
rather sharp humeri; the disc convex, feebly transversely gibbous below the base, hollowed at the sides
behind the humeral 661166, deeply excavate and foveate within the hasal margin, and foveate near the
suture below the base and also in the middle, with rows of widely scattered, rather coarse, fuscous punc-
turae, here and there interrupted by transverse ridges; the margins very broadly expanded, becoming
narrow at the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of deep foveae. Anterior

tarsal claws angularly dilated ; the intermediate and hind tarsa] claws pectinate.
Length 43-5ὲ, breadth 43-43 millim.

Hah. Cos'rA RICA ( Van Patten); PANAMA, Bugab'a (Clzampion).

Eleven exampleS, one only of which is from Costa Rica. This insect may be
known from all the other Central·American species of the genus by its flavous colour3
the punctures on the elytra and some small spots on the prothorax fuscouS.
