228 PHYTOPHAGA.

Museum, which only differs from typical 0. plicata in having the black dorsal patch of
the elytra narrower and not extending so far posteriorly, and sometimes with a narrow
flavous fascia behind. The scutellum is black. The elytral margins are perhaps a
little broader than in the male of 0. plicata, the elytra themselves obtuse at the apex
in this sex· The type from the Stockholm Museum is figured.

Var. α. The black annulus on the elytra narrower and not reaching the apex, obliquely truncate or rouuded
behind, the space enclosed varying in colour from flavous to sanguineous, and with irregular black spots,
which are sometimes obliterated. (Fig. 9.)

Var. β. The black annulus on the elytra still narrower, extending almost to the apex, nearly obliterated in
pale specimens, the space enclosed usually flavo-testaceous‚ broadly bordered with sanguineous, sometimes
entirely sanguineous, and with the puncturas placed upon dilute fuscous dots. (Fig. 10.)

Three well-marked forms occur of this variable species 2—(1) (0. vivida), with an
exceedingly broad black annulus on the elytra; (2) (var. α, 0. πίρνοοίηοτα), with the
annulus a little shorter and not so wide, the space enclosed usually irregularly spotted
with black; (3) (var. β, C. tabida), with the annulus still narrower, sometimes not
reaching the suture behind, the space enclosed bordered within with sanguineous or
dilute sanguineous, or entirely of that colour. These forms are connected by inter·
mediate gradations, and all three have been collected together at the same localities
in Mexico and in the State of Panama3 so there can be little doubt that they belong
to one variable species Most of the Panama specimens of the typical form and of the
var. tabida have the space enclosed by the annulus sanguineouS. Ο. niqrocincta, Wag.,
the type of which has been lent me by M. Rene Oberthiir, is based upon a specimen of
the var. α with the flavous dorsal patch on the elytra irregularly marked with black,
and the black patch on the prothorax reduced in size ; some of the Panama examples‚
and the one from Costa Rica‚ scarcely differ from it. 0. vivida is a very variable
and abundant Central·American insect, and 0. punicea is probably a pale variety of it.
