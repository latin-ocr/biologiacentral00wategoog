We have received two specimens of this obscure species, O. marculenta is
exceedingly like a pallid G. annexa, Boh., with which species it was mixed in the
Salle collection ; but is broader‚ and also differs from it in having the elytral margins
entirely subhyaline posteriorly (the faint fuscous line on the outer part of the dise not
extending across the margin to the exterior limb at one-third from the apeX, as in that
species). The flavo-testaceous colour extends across the elytral margins nearly to the
humeri, a character distinctly visible in the type, but not mentioned by Boheman.
sse third joint of the antennae is a little longer than the second, and shorter than
the fourth. The male is shorter and more rotundate than the female. The type from

the Stockholm Museum is figured.

77. Coptocycla profligata. (Tab. XII. fig. 13.)

An abundant Central-American insect. 0. profliqatffl the type of which is before
me, is compared by Boheman with 0. immunda (a pale variety of 0. siquera, Herbst‚
:quttata, Boh.); but it is, in reality‚ a very close ally of 0. bicolor—some of the
specimens of the species in the Salle collection were indeed so labelled‚—from which
it differs in having a dark transverse fascia on the elytral margins at the base. The
third joint of the antennae is slightly longer than the second.
