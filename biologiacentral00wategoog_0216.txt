the elytra with a very broad black oblong annulus on the outer part of the disc, extending to far beyond
the middle, more or less obliquely truncate behind, and enclosing a moderately large, rounded‚ common
flavous patch, which is sometimes divided at the suture by a narrow black line; the antennas flavous‚ the
apical joint infuscate attho tip3 beneath and the legs flavous. Antennae moderately long, slender‚ the
apical five joints a little thickened, joint 3 slightly longer than 2. Prothorax about twice as broad as
long, broadly expanded and reticulate at the sides and in frent 3 the disc obsoletely canaliculato and with
a few minute scattered punctures behind, very feebly depressed on either side of the median lobe at the
base. Elytra about three times as long as the prothorax‚ and very much wider than it, very deeply
emarginate at the base, aud with prominent rather sharp humeri; the disc moderately convex‚ hollowed
at the sides behind the humeral callus, and foveate before the middle, with an impresscd sutural stria
posteriorly‚ somewhat closely seriata-punctate-—the punctures moderately fine towards the sature, coarse
at the sides, and almost obsolcte on the flavous apical portiom—the interstices smooth and flat: the
margins broadly expanded, becoming gradually narrower towards the apex, smooth and reticulate,
separated from the disc by a row of moderately deep foveae. Claws simple.

Length ‚eg-52, breadth 5 minim.

Seven specimenS. Allied to 0. my0p3, 0. puella, &c., but larger, with a broad,
entirely black annulus, which is less obliquely truncate behind, and the scutellum
black. In one specimen the annulus is transversely truncate behind.

34. eoptoeyola balteata. (Τὼ. XI. fig. 3.)

Rotundate, convex‚ shining3 the prothorax with the disc black, the margins flavo-hyaline3 the scutellum
fiamus, narrowly bordered with fuscous3 the elytra with a broad black annulus extending round the disc
and nearly reaching the apex, the enclosed portion rufo-testaceous‚ with rows of fuscous dots showing
through from the inner side, the margins flavo-hyaline3 the legs and antennae flavo-testaceous; the
under surface black, the prothorax at the sides and the abdomen flavo-testaceous. Antennae moderately
long, slender‚ the apical five joints a little thickened‚ joint 3 not longer than 2. Prothorax oue-half
broader than long, broadly expanded and reticulate at the sides and in front, feebly sinuato at the base
on either side of the median lobe; the disc with a few rather deep puncturas at the base towards the
sides, and obliquely grooved on either side of the median lobe. Elytra much wider than, and about two
and a half times as long aa, the prothorax, deeply emarginate at the base, with moderately prominent
rather obtuse humeri; the disc convex‚ shallowly foveate in the centre before the middle and bifoveate
at the base, with rows of very fine punctures which become coarse towards the sides and almost obsolete
towards the apex (the sutural row excepted), the interstices smooth and fiat3 the margins broadly
expanded, becoming very narrow at the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of

deep foveae. ⁸ Claws simple.
Length 43, breadth 32 millim.

Hah. PANAMA, Volcan (16 Chiriqui (Oltampion).

One specimen. This species resembles 0. atroammlus in colour, but it is only about
half the size of that insect; it also differs in having the prothoiax grooved on either side
of the median lobe at the base, the black annulus extending almost to the apex of the
elytra, the disc of the prothorax entirely black, that of the elytra more distinctly
foveate before the middle. The broad black annulus extending nearly to the apex, in
connection with the small size and rotundate shape, separates 0. balteata from the
other allied species here enumerated.
