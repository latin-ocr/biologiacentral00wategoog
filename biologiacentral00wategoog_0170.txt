I have examined the types of 0. catenulam and (Ι. ll-maoulata, and they only
differ in colour and size. The species is a very variable one, as noticed by Boheman,
and the elytra are sometimes entirely black. 0. omissa was based upon abraded
specimens of this dark form. Ο. catenulam may chiefly be known by its moderately
convex shape (ὅ subrotundate‚ ῼ ovate) and pubescent surface, the elytra and the
sides of the prothorax rather coarsely punctured. Specimens occur with the spots
small, sometimes with only three on each elytron3 those from Western Mexico are
much larger than the others. We figure a male of one of Boheman’s types of
C'. catenulam (fig. 5), from Playa Vicente‚ a female of his 0. ll-maoulata (from the
Stockholm Museum) (fig. 6), and a female of the variety a from Capetillo (fig. 7).

Apparently peculiar to the'eastern and southern parts of Mexico, six varieties of
this variable species are described by Boheman. 0. juvenca, especially in the male
sex, has very much the facies of an Epilaclma, of the family Coccinellidae3 it may be

known by its very pubescent upper surface and convex shape—subrotundate in the
male, ovate in the female.
