variegated with fulvous markings, which. form an irregular semicircular band extending
from the middle of the basal margin to the suture just before its middle, an irregular
fascia just below the middle of the elytron, and a transverse patch or fascia immediately

apical margin is also fulvous. ’ ’

Head moderately produced between the eyes3 front impressed on the medial line with
a shallow longitudinal groove. Antennae slender at the base, thickened towards the ’
apex, rather more than a third the length of the body; joints cylindrical, the 'basal
one short, the second about one half longer than the first, rather shorter than the third,
and about equal in length to the fourth. Thorax nearly twice as· broad as long; sides
nearly straight and parallel at the base, rounded and dilated in the middle, converging
” at the apex, the anterior angle armed with a stout subacute tooth 3 transversely convex;
surface unequal, transversely excavated on either side· just before the base3 velvety,
nearly impunctate on the sides, impressed on the middle disc with a few large piceous
punctures; latera] margin and base stained with nigro-piceous. - Scutellum piceous.
Elytra much broader than the thorax ; sides gradually dilated from the middle to the
posterior angle, the latter produced laterally into a triangular plate; apical margin
