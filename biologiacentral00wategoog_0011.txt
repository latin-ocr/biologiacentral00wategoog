INTRODUGTION.

Tms volume is devoted to two families of the Phytophagous Coleoptera, the Hispidae
and Cassididae. The Hispidae‚ with the exception of a short appendix, have been
wholly dealt with by the late J. S. Baly, the Cassididae by myself. Baly has already
contributed some general remarks upon the Hispidae‚ so that, as regards this family, it is
necessary to add only some particulars as to the number of genera and species represented
within our limits. Altogether, for the two familieS, 453 species are enumerated, the
numbers being almost evenly apportioned—Hispidae 226, Cassididae 227. In the
Hispidae 169 new species and two new genera, and in the Cassididae 55 new species
and two new genera, have been described. The total number of species of Hispidae
for the whole world is given as 496 in the Munich Catalogue (1874), and for the
Cassididae 1795. This disproportion in the numbers of the two families, as compared
with those for Central America, is, however, partly due to the fact that the Cassididae
have been exhaustively monographed by Boheman (1850-62), while no monograph
of the Hispidae has yet appeared. Nevertheless, Central America contains but a
limited number of Cassididae, as compared with Tropical South America: for example,
filesomphalia with 227 species (1874) has nineteen only within our limits; and many

other South-American genera are represented by a very small number of specieS, as
Desmonota, Tauroma, Dolichotoma, Calaspiclea, and omoplata‚ or are altogether absent,

as Callia-spis, Spiloplzora, Canistra, and Poecilaspi& Mexico and Guatemala, however,
possess a number of peculiar species of Cassididae, especially in the genera Chelymorplza,
Physonota, Copton-yda, and Ctenochira, very few of which reach our northern frontier.
Panama or Costa Rica appears to be the northern limit of such genera as Delocrania‚
Desmonota, Calaspidea, and Omaspidoe. America north of Mexico (Henshaw’s
Catalogue, 1885) has thirty-five species of Hispidae and twenty species of Cassididae
(three of which are doubtful)—North America, for some, at present, inexplicable
reason, possessing exceedingly few Cassididae. Cassida, the only European genus of the
family, and with upwards of 200 species in the Old World, is represented by very
few species in North or Central America, it there being replaced by Coptocyola.
