Hah. NORTH AMERIOA, Arizona (Hom).—mel00, Monclova in Coahuila (Dr. Palmer),
Guanajuato (Salle').

Vertex impressed with a shallow groove. Antennae rather longer than the head and
thorax3 joints cylindrical, the five upper ones forming an oval club, the two lower ones
pale piceous. Thorax transverse; sides straight and nearly parallel from the base nearly
to the apeX, thence quickly converging to the anterior angle, the latter produced into a
subacute tooth 3 disc coarsely and closely rugose-pun ctate, transversely excavated before,
and again behind the middle, the space between forming an ill-defined transverse
elevation, from the middle of which a short perpendicular ridge runs backwards to the
basal margin, dividing the hinder depression into two sections. Elytra oblong; sides
parallel anteriorly‚ slightly dilated behind the middle, rounded at the apert, the hinder
angle slightly produced laterally, broadly rounded3 outer margin finely but distinctly
serrulate3 disc punctate-striate, the whole surface covered with a number of raised
piceous reticulations, which form an irregular network over the surface, more especially
on the hinder half, the reticulations on the anterior disc being less raised and ana-
stomosing less freely with each other than those behind the middle of the elytra; an
irregular longitudinal ridge running upwards from the middle disc to the basal margin.

Broader and shorter than Ο. scabmeenm‘s, the reticulations on the anterior half of
the elytra less distinctly raised ; more variable in tint, in some specimens the entire disc
being dark piceous; in one from Guanajuato the anterior disc (including its reticulations)
is pale piceo-fulvous. This insect, described under the above name by Dr. Horn, agrees
with Ο. plicatula, Fabr.‚ a North-American species; but differs from Ο. scabripennis and
Ο. champiom' in its femora being unarmed.

*⁵ Elytra sev-iatefflwnctate ; interspaces plane or costato.

a. Antennae not lonqer than the head and thorax τορεύων, four to five ‘appar joints
fominq a distinct olub.
