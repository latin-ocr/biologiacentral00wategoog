vi ‚ INTRODUOHON.

The majority of the Cassididae are essentially tropioal, and probably more than· one
half of the described species inhabit Tropical South America. Some genera, as
Phys-semota, Coptocyola‚ menoclem, the eastern Aspidomorpha‚ δια, contain many
species which are most brilliantly golden, silvery, or opalescent in life, the metallica

colours fading immediately after death. These veritable living gems form 'a charac-
teristic feature in tropical insect-life.

The Hispidae are much more retired in their habits than the Cassididae, and the
specieS‚ with some few exceptionS‚ are by no means so numerous in individuale, many
of them occurring as single specimens on leaves in the forest. Some remarks upon

· their habits are given by Baly. A large number of undescribed species exist in
