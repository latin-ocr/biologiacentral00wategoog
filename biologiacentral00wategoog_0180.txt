164 PHYTOPHAGA.

iii. Elytra with a compre-seed, obtuse, transverse elevation before the middle.

8. Batonota eremita.
Batonota eremita, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv. p. 240¹.

Hab. Cos-m R1cA (coll. Dohrn 1).

Apparently exceedingly close to, and perhaps not distinct from, B. insidiosa, from
which it seems to differ in having the elytra marked with smaller and more numerous
spots, and the elevation obtuse (instead of subacuminate‚ as in B. insidiosa).

9. Batonota biplagiata. (Tab. VIII. figg. 1ος 10 a, profile; 10 b, antenna.)

Subtriangular, broad 3 the upper surfaee opaque, clothed with a very short, fine, matteras, ashy pubescenee 3
the head, antennae, prothorax, scutellum, legs, and the body beneath black3 the elytra green or bluish-
green, each with a very large dilute sanguineous or rufo-testaceous patch occupying fully half the entire
surface—extending from the base to far beyond the middle and almost surrounding the ante-median
elevation, and laterally (from a little behind the humeral carina to beyond the middle) to very near the
outer margin. Head sparsely punctured and canaliculato between the eyes; antennae extending to far
beyond the humeri, joints 1-5 almost smooth‚ shining, 2 and 3 very short, equal, 4 and 5 longer, 5 longer
than 4, 6-11 densely punctured and opeque, 6 elongate, as long as 3-5 united, 6-10 equal in length,
11 much longer than 10. Prothorax strongly transverse, broadly and feebly arcuato-emarginate in frent,
the sides rapidly arcuately converging from the base, the base deeply emarginate on either side of the
broad slightly emarginate or truncate median lobe and thence to the hind angles very obliquely truncate;
the disc obsoletely longitudinally carinatc in the middle in front; the margins concava, moderately
expanded3 the entire surface thickly, very minutely punctate. Scutellum foveate in the middle. Elytra
at the base nearly twice as wide as the prothoraX, subtr-iangular, conjointly rounded at the apex, narrowing
from the base, with a strongly compressed, transverse, obtuse elevation before the middle 3 the disc coar-sely,
closely, subseriately punctured, and with two irregular carinae near the suture and one about the middle,
the puncturas on the apical portion much finer and shallower ; the margins very broadly expanded‚ thickly‚
finely, confusedly punctured, and separated from the dise by a row of very coarse‚ deep impressions3 the
humeri prominent but obtuse, reflexed and slightly oblique in front, and with an oblique carina extending
inwards to the prominent humeral callae. Beneath shim’ng, sparsely pubescant, the apex of each ventral
segment fringed with longer hairs3 prosternum very deeply sulcate.

Length 14-14g, breadth 13-133 millim.

Hah. PANAMA, Volcan de Chiriqui 4000 feet (Champion).

Two examples, from the western slope of the Volcano. Allied to B. rufo-ornata,
B. seaplaqiata, &c. 3 but with a more obtuse elytral elevation (not at all acuminate, if
viewed from behind), the elytra each with a very large dilute sanguineous or rufo-
testaceous patch occupying half the entire surface.

CISTUDINELLA.

Head deeply withdrawn beneath the prothorax3 the latter broadly rounded or truncate anteriorly, the base
broadly arcuata-emarginate on either side aud with an obtuse median lobe, the hind angles sharp and
produced backwardS, the anterior angles obliterated3 the scutellum small, strongly transverse3 the elytra
forming almost a continuous outline with the prothorax3 prosternum truncated in frent, proudced aud
very broadly, triangulme dilated behind the coxae, and received by the deeply excavate v-shaped
