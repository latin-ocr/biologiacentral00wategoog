COPTOCYCLA . 199

scarce, single specimens only having been obtained at most of the localities quoted.
The antennae are short, only extending to the base of the prothorax3 the third joint

is not longer than the second. The margins of the prothorax form almost a continuous
outline with those of the elytra.

31. Coptocycla aot-romulus. (Tab. X. figg. 27, ῼ; 27 a, antenna.)

Subrotundate (6 ), broad ovate (ῼ ), moderately convex, flavous or flavo-testaceous‚ shining, the margins
subhyaline; the eyes black3 the prothorax with a large black hasal patch‚ rounded anteriorly and
occupying fully half the disc; the scutellum varying in colour from flavo-testaceous to black3 the elytra
with a broad black oblong annulus on the outer part of the disc, extending to near the apex, and enclosing
a large, oval‚ flavo-testaceous or sanguineous patch ; the antennae flavous, with the apical joint black at
the tip ς hencath and the legs flavous or flavo-testaceous. Antennae moderately long, slender, the apical five
joints a little thickened, joint 3 slightly longer than 2. Prothorax nearly twice as broad as long, broadly
expanded and reticulate at the sides and in front‚ and very obliquely truncate on either side at the base,
almost smooth, the disc obsoletely canaliculato and feebly depressed at the base on either side of the
median lobe. Elytra very much broader than the prothorax, and nearly three times as long as it,
conjointly rounded at the apex in both sexes, and very deeply emarginate at the base, with prominent
humeri; the disc moderately convex, slightly hollowed at the sides behind the humeral callus, with a
deep sutural stria posteriorly, sedate-punctate—the punctures fine and approximate towards the sutore.
rather coarse and subremote at the sides, and almost obsoleto before the apex,—the interstices smooth

and flat3 the margins very broadly expanded, becoming gradually narrower towards the apex, smooth
and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of moderately deep foveoe. Claws simple.

Length 743, breadth 63-7 millim.

Eleven examples. This insect bears a deceptive resemblance to Ο. circumducta,
Boh., but it may be at once distinguished from that species by the more elongate third
joint of the antennae (in 0. circumducta the third joint is shorter than the second); it
is also smaller, with shorter antennae and a narrower annulus to the elytra, the latter
not at all gibbous anteriorly, almost smooth at the apex, and not broadly subtruncate
behind in the male. Numerous closely allied South-American species have been
described by Boheman. We figure an example from Bugaba.

Hah. MnxlcO, Cordova (δἀἷῖέ 1).

The three specimens in the Salle collection are all I have seen of this species. The
antennae are moderately long and subfilfform, with the second and third joints equal in
length, the third nearly as stout as the second.

· 33. Coptocycla ambita. (Tab.x1.fig. 2.)

Subrotundate, moderately convex, flavous, shining‚ the margins subhyaline; the eyes black3 the prothorax
with a rather large transverse black patch at the base, which is rounded anteriorly3 the scutellum black ε
