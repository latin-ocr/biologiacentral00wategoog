above and beneath and the legs testaceous.

Hah. PANAMA‚ Bugaba (Clzampion). Two male specimenS.

β. The elytra immaculate, flavo-testaceum, testaceoue‚ or ferrugineus, the suture usually more or less infuscata
anteriorly ; the prothorax sometimes with a narrow median vitta 3 the under eurface and lege varying in

colour from black to testaceous. (Fig. 14.)

This insect is very closely allied to M. coeruleonotata‚ and it is perhaps not really
distinct from that species (of which I have only seen a single example); but the
punctuation of the elytra is very much finer, and the prothorax has the sides straighter
behind. The spotted and the immaculate forms have been received from the same
localities, and I do not hesitate to put them together: the latter closely resembles
M. suturalia, Boh., from Cayenne‚ but it has the elytra more uniformly punctured.
The colour of the under surface and legs is variable. M. varians, Boh., from Cayenne
&c.‚ is an allied form, specimens of which occur with the elytral spots almost obliterated.
We figure a pair of the typical form from Costa Rica, and a male of the unspotted

variety from Bugaba.

14. Mesomphalia aeneovittata. (Tab. VI. fig. 15, a .)

6 . Rotundum, moderately convert, slightly shining3 the head and prothorax testaceous, the latter with a
broad median vitta extending from the base to the apex and narrowing anteriorly‚ and an oblong patch
midway between this and the lateral margin, aeneous‚ the margins a little more dilute and dotted with
fuscous3 the scutellum aeneoue; the elytra flavo-testaceous, each with two broad aeneous vittas, which
become confluent posteriorly—the inner one constricted before the middle and not reaching the base, the
outer one sinuous, occupying a considerable portion of the expanded margin, and extending over the
humeral callus to the base‚-and the sutura nearly to the apex—broadly anteriorly, narrowly behind—
oeneous; the antennae blech, with the three baaal joints, and the fourth and fifth beneath‚ testaceous;
the legs testaceous; the underside black. Hcad deeply canaliculate‚ rugulosely punctured 3 antennae
rather stout, extending a little beyond the base of the protborax‚ the four basal joints shining, the othere
opeque. Prothorax twice as broad as long, rather feebly arcuata-emarginate in frunt, the sides rapidly
arcuately converging from the base, obliquely so anteriorly‚ the base truncate on either side, the median
lobe obtuse and moderately produced; the disc eparsely, very finely punctam, depressed in the middle
behind, and with a very fine median line, which is deeply impressed at the base3 the margins dull,
almost smooth‚ rather concave‚ deeply foveate behind the middle. Scutellum smooth, moderately large.
Elytra more than three times the length of, and in the widest part about one half broader than, the
pretinm-ax, at the base scarcely broader thenit, conjointly rounded at the apex; the disc moderately
gibbous before the middle; the margins broadly expanded‚ deflexed‚ rounded and widest before the
