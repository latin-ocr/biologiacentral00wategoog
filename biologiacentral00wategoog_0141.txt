DELocRAMA. 125

Pam. cas-smum ἦ

The characters used to separate this Family from the Hispidae are of exceedingly
doubtful value3 and some of the species placed in Himatidium by Boheman really
belong to Demotispa, Baly‚ a genus of Hispidae. Most of the south-American genera
are represented within our limits by at least one specieS, but several are wholly absent,
as Sphaeropalpm, Calopepla, Calliaspis, Spiloplzora‚ Canistra‚ and Poecilaspis. The head-
quarters of the family in the New World is in Tropical South America. Okelymovplm
and Physonota are perhaps the most characteristic genera of the Central-American
Cassididee, and Platycycla is peculiar to Mexico and Guatemala. Eurypepla is common
to the Antilles and Yucatan. Further remarks on the distribution of the Gentral·

American representatives of the family will be given in the “ Introduction '' to this
Volume.

This remarkable genus contains three or four closely allied species, all peculiar to

Tropical America3 one only, D. cossyplzoides, Guer„ has been described. It has the

first and second ventral segments connate, the suture between them being almost
obliterated in the middle.

1. Deloerania panamensis. (Tab. v. fig. 1.)

Oblong, subparallel, dull ferrugineus, the dilated margins of the prothorax and elytra flavo-testaceous3 the
antennae ferruginous‚ wit-h the five or six outer joints (the tip of the eleventh excepted) infuscate or
piceous. Head with a few rather coarse puncturee behind, canaliculato in the middle in front. Pro-
thorax moderately coarsely, irregularly, and closely punctured on the disc; the margins somewhat thickly
covered with transverse or oblique foveae, each formed by two confluent puncturas. Elytra scarcely
wider than the prothorax, subpar-allel in their basal half 3 the disc coarsely and closely seriam-punctam,
the subur-e and the fifth interstice costate; the margins with four rows of moderately course impressions‚
those of the innermost row (the ninth from the suture) coarser and deeper than the others, the interspaces
feebly transversely wrinkled ; beneath shining, very sparsely‚ minutely punctured.

Length 5, breadth 23 millim.
