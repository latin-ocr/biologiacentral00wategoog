Hah. Mssxlco 2-⁵(Clzevrolat1 ; Ηαῑίἑ, excoll. Sum-m), CordovastSaZZc),Cuernavaca(Hiiqe).

Ι have seen four specimens of this insect, including one, no doubt the type, from the
Ohevrolat collection in the British Museum. P. separata only differs from P. vittioollis

in having much fewer punctures on the disc of the elytra‚ these being widely separate
one from another.

Physgnota bicolor, Sturm, in litt.

Hah. anco ¹²3 (Solle, ex coll. Sturm), Oaxaca (Hbye).

There are two examples of this peculiar species in the Salle collection, withou‘t
nearer indication of locality. The type from the Stockholm Museum is figured. A
rather narmW, oval species, with coarse, subserially arranged punctures on the elytra,
the margins also coarsely punctured. The single specimen from Oaxaca is much

smaller than the type, and has the dorsum os the elytra pitchy·brown, probably from
discoloration.

Hah. MExlco 1-3, Guanajuato (Sane), Tula and Pachuca in Hidalgo (H'o‘qe).

Sent in plenty by H6ge from the State of Hidalgo. P. mea-icam is closely allied to
P. ovata, Boh., but may easily be known from it by the blackish arcuate or >-shaped
mark on either side of the disc of the prothorax near the base, midway between which
is a short oblong streak3 the elytra are rather coarsely‚ irregularly‚ sei-iate punctate‚
the margins also coarsely punctured.

15. Physonota flavago. (Tab. v111. fig. 22.)

Hah. MExlco 1’3, Ciudad in Durango 8100 feet (Fower).

We figure the type from the Stockholm Museum. Very closely allied to P. picti·
collis, Boh., but differing from it in the immaculate prothoraX‚ and in having the
elytra more coarsely and more closely punctured. The two specimens ( ό ῼ ) received
