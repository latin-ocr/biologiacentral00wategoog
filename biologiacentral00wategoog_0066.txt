1. chalspus morio. (Ταῦ. 111. fig. 4.)
Hispa morio, Fabr. Syst. t. 2. f. 60.

Sat elongat-us, niger, subtus nitidus, supra subnitidus; thorace transverso, subconico, disco utrinque calloso,
medio rude foveolato-punctato 3 elytris parallelis, ad suturam late subquadrato-emarginaffis, utrisque octo-
Iangoegaff-npumssaffi’ interstitiis granulosis, planis, interspatio secundo costato.

Hah. Mmoo, Toluca, Guanajuato (Saue).

Head moderately produced between the eyes; vertex and front trisulcate. Antennae
very slightly thickened towards the apex; two lower joints equal in length, the third
as long as the preceding two united. Thorax transverse, subconic; sides nearly straight,
converging from the base to the apex; disc with a longitudinal callosity on either side,
closely and coarsely punctured. Elytra broader than the thorax, parallel, broadly sub-
quadrate·emarginate at the suture, the sutural angle acute; lateral margin obsoletely,
the apical one distinctly, serrulate3 each elytron with eight rows of punctures, the
second interspace‚ together with the suture, costate3 interstices between the punctures
granulose, plane.

The original type of Hispa morio, Fabr., is in all probability lost. Ι have therefore,
following Dr. ChapuiS, adopted the Fabrician name, by which this species is known in
most collections3 the diagnosis given by Fabricius is extremely brief, and the locality
given merely as South America.

Elongatus‚ niger, nitidus3 pectore femoribusque flavis, his ad apicem nigro maculatis3 capite fulvo trimaculatog
antennis ad corporis longitudinem fere aequalibus, articulis intermediis compressis, dorso modice cristatis3
thorace crebre foveolato-punctato, utrinque late flavo-fulvo vittato; elytris subparallelis, apicem versus

Hah. Pmm, Volcan de Chiriqui (OEampicm).

Front rather strongly produced between the eyes, irregularly grooved. Vertex smooth;
a patch on either side of the neck, together with one on the front, extending downwards
to the base of the antennae, fulvous. Antennae nearly four fifths the length of the body ;
first and second joints subovate, equal, the third and the following three compressed,
cristate, the third equal in length to the first and second united, the sixth and following
ones cylindrical. Thorax nearly one fourth broader than long at the base, slightly
converging towards the apex, sides subaugulate, anterior angle armed with a short
oblique tooth; upper surface cylindrical on the sides, flattened on the disc, closely
