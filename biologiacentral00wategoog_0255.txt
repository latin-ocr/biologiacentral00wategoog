Hah. Mnxlco, Temax in North Yucatan ( Gaumer).

Two specimens. This species is rnearest allied to Ο. hepbumi, Baly, but it has much
more strongly costate elytra‚ the sixth interspace also being costate towards the base3
and the prothorax is more opaque and has obtuse anterior angles, The coloration
resembles that os 0. contubernalis and 0. chapuisi, Baly; but both these species are
more elongate, and have a short additional row of punctures at the base of the elytra,
and longer antennoe. The penultimate joints of the antennae are closely, but freely,
articulated and transverse.
