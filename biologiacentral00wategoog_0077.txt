Hah. Manno, Playa Vicente (Sallek Guxmmx, Zapote (Champion); NIOARAGUA,
Chontales (Janson); PANAMA, Caldera in Chiriqui 1200 feet, David, Taboga Island
(Champion).

Vertex smooth, im punctate ; front longitudinally sulcate 3 interocular space moderately
produced, obtuse. Antennae rather longer than the head and thorax, robust, thickened
towards the apex; joints cylindrical, the five outer ones forming an ill-defined slender
club. Thorax broader than long ; sides converging and slightly rounded from base to
apex, obsoletely angulate3 disc transversely convex, excavated transversely behind the
middle, coarsely and closely punctured ; lateral margin (in some specimens) narrowly
edged with piceous. Elytra broader than the thorax ; sides slightly enlarged from the
base towards the apex, the latter obtuse3 margin serrulate ς each elytron with ten, on
the anterior disc with nine, rows of punctureS, the seventh and eighth rows abbreviated
posteriorly 3 the second, fourth, and sixth interspaces (the last at base and apex) strongly
costate, the eighth less strongly elevated‚ its apex cristate, serrulate3 the third costa
arises from the apex of the humeral calluS, and runs obliquely downwards to join the
second one at the termination of its anterior third; its apical portion is confluent with
the cristate apex of the fourth.

21. Chalepus subapicalis.

Anguste oblongae, subcuneiformis, nitidus ; subtus cum capite niger, femoribus anticis basi thoraceque fulvis ;
supra minus nitidus, piceo-fulvus, elytrorum fascia lata subapicali picea3 thorace transverso, subcylin-
drico‚ lateribus angulatis, disco postico transversim excavato, subopaco, rude et crebre punctam, margine
antico lateribusque anguste piceis3 elytris oblongis, apicem versus vix ampliatis, apice obtuse rotundatis,
margine serratis, dorso deplanatis 3 utrisque decem- paullo ante medium nono-seriato-punctatis; interstitiis
elevato-reticulatis3 interspatiis secundo, quarto et octavo, nec non sexto basi et apice, costatis; costis
duabus externis serrulatis.

Hah. Mnxrco, J uquila, Oaxaca (Saue).

Vertex smooth, impunctate3 front longitudinally grooved, finely rugose·punctate on
either side3 interocular space very. slightly produced. Antennae slightly longer than
the head and thorax, robust, slightly increasing in thickness towards the apex. Thorax
transverse3 sides slightly but distinctly angulate‚ straight and nearly parallel from
the base to the middle, thence obliquely converging towards the apex; transversely
convex, excavated on the hinder disc, closely, deeply, and coarsely punctured. Elytra
broader than the thorax; sides regularly but only slightly dilated from the base towards
the apex, the apex itself obtusely rounded, the outer margin rather strongly serrulate ;
each elytron at the extreme base with ten, just before the middle with nine, rows of punc-
tures3 second, fourth, and eighth interspaces costate, the sixth also elevated at its base
and apex.
