one smaller and rounded), and one on either side of the disc about the middle (strongly transverse and
almost in a line with the O-shaped basal one)-black or piceous; the elytra usually with an oblong
piceous spot on the humeral callus3 the antennae testeos-cus, joints 3-'7 usually more or less infuscate

above; the legs testaceous, the femora largely marked with black (except on their lower side), the tibiae
with a black line along their outer edge; the body beneath black, the sides broadly (a transverse patch
on each ventral segment excepted), and also the prosternal process, testaceous. Head grooved between
the eyes, thickly and somewhat coarsely punctured below3 antennae rather stout‚ reaching to the base of
the prothorax, joints 3 and 4 elongate, equal in length, 3 twice as long as 2, 5-10 slightly decreasing in
length, stouter than 4, 11 much longer than 10, acuminate. Prothorax about twice as broad as long,
bisinuate at the base, with the median lobe broad and rounded, the sides very abruptly and rather
obliquely converging anteriorly, strongly rounded behind, the apex rounded3 the lateral and apical
margins very broadly expanded‚ reticulate, the lateral margins transversely hollowed before and behind
the middle; the disc obsoletely canaliculate and transversely depressed before the base ; the surface very
sparsely, minutely punctured, the punctures a little more distinct on the basal portion of the disc.
Scutellum almost smooth. Elytra one half wider than, and three times as long as, the prothorax, a little
longer in the female, narrowing from about the hasal fourth, conjointly rounded at the apex, the humeri
broadly rounded} the margins very broadly expanded, deeply hollowed below the base internally,
reticulate3 the disc irregularly, rather closely, and somewhat coarsely punctured‚ and with an irregular
row of deep foveoe separating it from the margins, the latter more finely and more sparsely punctured.

1 have seen six examples of this very large species, which is much larger and broader

than P. yiqcmtea, Boh. P. pellucida, Wag., from Demerara, about equals it in size3
but it differs in several particulars from the insect here described. The two specimens
in Mr. O. E. J anson’s collection are labelled with the name I have adopted.

Unknown to me. The specimen in the British Museum determined as P. incrustata
by Boheman 3, not the actual type, seems to be only a discoloured male specimen of
