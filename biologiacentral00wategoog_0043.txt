Mas. Abdominis segmento anali late sed leviter transversim emarginato.
Fam. Abdominis segmento anali late sed leviter transversim excavato, utrinque leviter sinuato.

Long. 1} lin.
Hah. PANAMA, Bugaba (Chamon).

Vertex and front deeply impressed with two· closely approximating longitudinal grooves,
which run downwards as far as the insertion of the antennae‚ the space between forming
a slight and obsoletely thickened longitudine] ridge. Antennae scarcely longer than the
head and thorax, robust; two basal joints short, equal, rufo-piceous, glabrous, the rest
black, closely clothed with 'adpressed concolorous hairs. Thorax transverse3 sides parallel
from the base to some distance beyond the middle, thence rounded and converging to
the aPeX, anterior angle scarcely produced, broadly rounded, apical margin truncate;
upper surface transversely convex, sparingly impressed with large but shallow punctures.
Scutellum longer than broad, subcordate, the apex acute. Elytra narrowly oblong ; sides
straight and parallel, obliquely rounded and converging near the apex, the apex itself
truncate; above convex, sinuate on the sides before the middle, regularly punctate-

striate.

The species of this genus are natives of South and Central America and the Antilles; λ
some of them bear a remarkable resemblance to certain forms of Cassididae (H imati—

dium), and, as seen below, the late H. Boheman described one (Η. limbatellum) as .

belonging to that genus.

Hah. GUATEMALA, Cubilguitz in Vera Paz 1000 feet (Ohampion).

Head smooth and shining; face concave between the eyeS, medial line with an oblong
ridge. Antennae nearly two thirds the length of the body, filiform; joints cylindrical,
first short, the second distinctly longer than the basal one, third longer than the
preceding two united; apex of the terminal joint piceous. Thorax more than twice as
