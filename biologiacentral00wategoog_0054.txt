38 PHYTOPHAGA.

face armed between the antennae with a minute tooth. Antennae nearly three fourths
the length of the body, slender, filiform3 joints cylindrical, basal one short, moniliform,
second to the fifth nearly equal in length, each about twice as long as the first ; four upper
joints obtuse, rufo-piceous, the three lower ones (in some specimens) obscure piceous.
Thorax scarcely longer than broad3 sides straight and parallel from the base to just
behind the middle, thence obliquely converging to the apex, the anterior angle armed
with a short obtuse tooth ; upper surface closely covered with large irregular foveolate
punctures, the space immediately behind the apical margin impunctate; a narrow vitta
on the medial disc, together with a few of the punctures on the extreme lateral margin,
nigro-piceous3 on the vitta is a very narrow and slightly raised longitudinal line.
Elytra elongate, parallel; sides very slightly sinuate and constricted in the middle3
apex obtusely rounded, the hinder angle armed with a short, acute, flattened spine, the
apex of which looks directly backwards; upper surface convex on the sides and apeX,
flattened along the suture; humeral callus produced laterally, its apex extending slightly
beyond the lateral margin, acute; each elytron with ten, at the extreme base with
eleven, regular rows of large deep punctures, which cover nearly the whole surface3
fourth interspace obsoletely costate; a narrow vitta, extending from the apex of the
humeral callus nearly to the middle of each elytron, less distinct and sometimes entirely
obsolete posteriorly, together with the spine at the hinder angle, nigro-piceous, tinged
with violaceous. In some specimens this colour is confined to the spine itself, in others
it extends inwards for a short distance across the disc.

Several examples were captured by Mr. Champion in the forest region of the low country.
