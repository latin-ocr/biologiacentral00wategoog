COPTOCYCLA. 213

The numerous specimens here referred to this species were labelled with the MS.
name C. lurida, Klug, in the Salle collection. They agree very well with Boheman's
description. 0. &vulnerata may be known from all the allied forms by its oval ( d )
οι· oblong ( <2 ) shape. The elytra are foveate on the disc before the middle, the fovea,
and a slender line on the outer part of the disc—in some specimens extending from a
little below the humeral callus to beyond the middle, in others obsolete—being dilute
fuscous. This species is widely distributed in Mexioe, and we have received many
specimens of it from Guanajuato and J alapa.

The elytra in this small species have on the disc before the middle an oblique dilute
olivaceous patch, which is connected externally with a longitudinal similarly-coloured
stripe extending from the humeral callus downwards‚ this stripe being continued in
some specimens to the suture. The antennae usually have the eighth and ninth joints

infuscate. We have received about thirty specimens of 0. hbqberqi. Ο. vinula, Boh.,
from Colombia, appears to be a very closely-allied form.
