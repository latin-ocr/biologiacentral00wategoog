CTENOCHIRA. 231

The males are more rotundato than the females, and they have the apex of the elytra

more obtuse. We figure a typical male example from Orizaba‚ and a female
specimen of var. α from Costa Rica.

The numerous examples from the above-mentioned localities agree with Boheman’s
description of this specim, except that the discoidal patch on the prothorax is black
(instead of partly ferrugineus), this patch enclosing nine flavous spot—four placed
transversely at the base and five in a curved row in front. The antennae are flamm,
with the tip of the apical joint black (in the allied Ο. retg'fera and O. reticulata two of
the outer joints are also black). The scutellum is yeIIOW. The disc of the elytra is
black, variegated with raised, transverse or oblique, flavous callositie8‚ which are here
and there confluent. We figure a specimen from Tapachula.

Not uncommon in the low country of Chiriqui. The antennae have their apical two
or three joints infuscate or black; the prothorax has a large subtriangular basal black

patch‚ enclosing five yellow spots; the scutellum is yellow; the elytra have the disc
black, each marked with ten slightly raised yellow spots, the posterior three of which
form an interrupted arcuate fascia. We figure an example from Chiriqui.

Α single specimen from Panama differs from the description of this species in
having the post-median transverse flavous fascia on the elytra extending across the disc

to the margins. The disc of the elytra is black, with a flavous ring on the basal part,
this being connected posteriorly with a curved fascia. The elytral markings resemble
those of Coptooycla annulus (Fabr.), except that the annulus and fascia are connected.
