230 PHYTOPHAGA.

Hah. Mssxlco 1-3, Chilpancingo‚ Atoyac (H. H. Smith), Matamoros Izucar‚ Panistla·
huaca in Oaxaca (Sulla), Misantla, Tapachula (Ηό96); GUATEMALA, Zapote (Champion).

Apparently a scarcer insect than most of the allied forms, O. coronata resembles
0. hieroquphz'oa, but it has the rows of punctures on the elytra less interrupted by
flavous reticulations, the punctures themselves placed in deep striae towards the suture
posteriorly ; the antennae usually with the eighth and ninth joints infuscate or black;
and the fiavous spots on the discoidal patch of the prothorax more emended, the central
ones often forming a coroniform mark. In a variety from Matamoros Izucar the elytra
have a large black patch at the base, not extending to the scutellum. We figure a
typical C. coronata from Chilpancingo and a variety from Tapachula.

Hah. MExmo 1-3, Playa Vicente, Cordova‚ Tuxtla, Orizaba (Sane), Jalapa (H'o‘qe),

Atoyac (H. H. Smiffi), Teapa in Tabasco (Heme, H. H. Smitlz); GUMEMAM, Senahn,
San J uan, T eleman‚ La Tinta‚ and Sinanja„ all in Vera Paz (Ckampion).

Var. α. The discoidal black patch on the prothorax with a single arcuate flavous spot before the base; the
punctures on the elytra much finer and shallower towards the apex, the flavous reticulations lar-ger and
tending to form broad fasciae. (Fig. 16.)

Hah. COSTA RmA (Van Patten) 3 PANAMA, Veragua 2 3.

Var. β. The punctus-es on the elytra coarse and placed in deep striae towards the suture posteriorly, the flavous
reticulations usually less distinct.

Hah. GUATEMALA‚ Las MercedeS, capetulo, San Geronimo (Champion) ; NchRAGUA‚
Chontales (Belt, Janson).

Var. γ. The discoidal black patch on the prothorax with a single transverse flavous mark in front3 the elytra
with a large cordate black patch at the base, extending to the scutellum, and a broad space beyond it
flamus, the sides only of the disc variegated with black, the punctures coarse and placed in deep striae
behind.

Hah. GUATEMALA, San Isidro (Champz'on). One specimen.

The typica] form of this species is not uncommon in the Mexican States of Vera Cruz
and Tabasco, and also in Vera Paz. Of the var. α, which is perhaps distinct, we have
only a single specimen. The var. β, which is not rare in Gnatemala and Nicaragua,
is almost intermediate between 0. hieroquplzioa and C. coronata, as it has the elytral
punctures placed in striae towards the apex as in 0. coronata. The antennae are flavouS,
with the tip of the apical joint black. The prothorax has a large triangular basal
black patch, enclosing three transverse flavous marks, which are sometimes partly obso-
lete3 in one specimen (from Chontales) the anterior spot extends completely acrosS.
The scutellum is yellow. The elytra have the disc black, irregularly reticulated with
yellow markingS, which interrupt the rows of punctureS.
