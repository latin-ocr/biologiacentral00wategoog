Unknown to me. 0. diana is stated 1 to be very similar to 0. wesmaeli in form, but
differently coloured.

Hah. Mnxlco, Cei-ro de Plumas (Ho’qe).-Sour11 Ammoi, Cayenne 1-3.

One example from Eastern MexicO, not differing from others from South America.
This remarkable species will probably have to be removed from Coptocycla, the elytra
being very feebly emarginate at the base, with the humeri subacute but not prominent,
the margins very broadly expanded to the apex, The antennae are rather long and
slender‚ with the third joint scarcely longer than the second.

29. Coptooycla isthmioa. (Tab. X. figg. 26, ῼ ; 26 α, antenna.)

Subrotundate (ὅ ), broad ovate ( ῼ ), convex‚ flavo-testaceous‚ shining‚ the margins subhyaline ; the antennae
testaceous‚ with joints 8-11, the tip of the eleventh exeepted, piceous or black3 beneath and the legs
testaceous. Antennae subfiliform‚ rather stent, extending to a little beyond the base of the prothorax,
joints 2 and 3 short, equal‚ 4 as long as 2 and 3 united, 5-7 subequal in length, each a little shorter than
4, 8-10 equal in length, each a little shorter than 7, 11 elongate, acuminate. Prothorax twice as broad
as long, broadly dilated and reticulate at the sides and in frent, the dise finely canaliculate in the middle
at the base, the surface smooth. Elytra about three times as long as the prothorax in the female,
shorter 1·n the male, and much wider than it, deeply sinuate-emarginate at the base, conjointly rounded
at the apex in both sexes3 the disc convex, with widely scattered‚ subserially arranged, moderately
coarse punctures‚ which usually become finer towards the suture and almost obsolete towards the ape13
the margins broadly expanded‚ smooth‚ concavo, separated from the disc by a row of deep foveae3 the
humeri prominent, a little more rounded in the female than in the male. Claws simple.

Length 7ᾖ-9, breadth 63-72 millim.

Ν ine examples. This insect is very like the Antillean 0. sub-siquam, Boh.; but it is
larger‚ and has the elytra immaculate and the third joint of the antennae not longer
than the second.
