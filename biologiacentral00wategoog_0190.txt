Hah. Mmco² ⁸ ⁶ ⁶ (coll. Sommer ¹ ⁴,- coll. Baby), Xucumanatlan in Guerrero (H. H.
Smitlz), Yolos in Oaxaca (Solle), Oaxaca ⁸ ⁹ (Deppe, in Mus. Berol.⁷).

There can be little doubt that the above synonymy is correct. P. spim'pes seems
only to differ from P. calcarata in having the markings on the prothorax reduced in size
——the median one in the form of a short vitta (instead of an anchor-shaped mark) and
the lateral ones c-shaped. This is the only species of Cassididae known to me in
which the tibiae are very broadly subaugularly dilated at the apeX.

PLATYCYCLA.
Ptatycyela, Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 240 (1854).

This genus contains but a single species, peculiar to Central America. It is closely
allied to Phyconota, especially to such species as P. eucalypta, P. translucida, δια, but
differs from it in the more slender‚ filiform antennae, joints 4-10 of which are relatively
more elongate, and in its more circular shape; the elytra are also much more deeply
emarginate at the base, and the prothorax is very obliquely truncate on either side

behind.

1. Platycycla deruta.

Platycycla demta, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 241, t. 5. figg. F, 1-5 ², and iv. p. 254² 3 Cat. Col.
Ins. Brit. Mus. ix. p. 104 ⁸.

Hah. Mmoo ¹·.·3‚ San Andres Tuxtla and Playa Vicente‚ both in Vera Cruz (Solle),
Minatitlan in Vera Oruz (H'o'qe)‚ Teapa in Tabasco (H. H. Smith); GUATEMALA‚ Goban‚

Chacoj‚ Teleman, and San Geronimo in Vera Paz (Gkampion)‚ Panzos in Vera Paz
(Conradt).

This fine species is not uncommon on the Atlantic slope of Gnatemala and Southern
MexicO.

EURYPEPLA.
Eurypepla, Boheman‚ Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 236 (1854).

Three species are referred to this genus by Boheman, two from the Antilles and one
from Yucatan.
