OALYPTOOEPHALA. 129

rar. The elytra more broad1y‚ especially posteriorly, bordered with coeruleous, the outer limb sometimes ferru-
gineus3 the sides of the prothorax also broadly bordered with coeruleous. .

Hah. GUATEMALA, Cubilguitz, Ghacoj, La Tinta, Teleman‚ and Panima, all in Vera
Paz (Champion), Panzos (Conradt); NrcARAeus, Choutales (Belt, Janson).

The type of this species has the thorax entirely te staceous, the elytra bordered with
caeruleous. The variety is coloured like 0. qerstoeokeri, Boh., from Bolivia; but it
differs from that insect, to judge from the description, in the more coarsely punctured
margins of the elytra. In 0. marqinipennis the elytral margins are very coarsely,
closely, and irregularly punctured, the punctures very much coarser than iu 0. brevi·
corni33 of this no mention is made by Boheman 1. The caeruleous border does not
always extend to the latera] and apical margins of the elytra‚ these parts being some-
times ferruginous, both in the type and in the variety. The tarsi are sometimes stained
with picenus, The antennae are entirely black.

3. Calyptocephala discoidea. (Tab. V. fig. 9.)

Subovate, rather convex; coeruleous‚ the elytra with the entire disc from the base to about one-third from the
apex flavo-testaceous or stramineous ; the scutellum coemleous, ferrugineus, or testaceou83 the antennae
black or pioeous‚ the basal one or two joints sometimes rufo-testaceous3 the under surfaoe and legs
entirely flavo-testaceous. Head smooth‚ depressed and canaliculato in the middle in front3 antennae
miserm, rather slen der, mode rately long. Prothorax short, moderately dilated at the sides, widest at the
middle, the sides rounded in frent and behind, the lateral margins not reflexed3 the anterior lateral
porticus dec livous, not projecting beyond the median portion (as viewed from above), and somewhat oblique ;
the base obliquely subtruncate on either side and with a broad median lobe3 the diso convex, smooth‚ some-
times with an irregular depression in the middle at the base, or with a fovea ou either side behind; the
margins flat, concavo towards the disc, with a few irregularly scattered, moderately coerce, puncturas.
Scutellum smooth. Elytra about four times the length of, and one half broader than, the prothorax, deeply
emarginate at the base, rapidly narrowing from about the basal third, the humeri rounded and prominent,
the apices conjointly rounded; the'disc with regular rows of moderat-ely coarse punctures, which become
very fine towards the apex, the interstices smooth3 the margins broadly expanded, very coarsely, irregularly‚
and somewhat closely punctured, the punctures coar-ser than those of the striae. Beneath shining, smooth‚

Length 5-5ὲ, breadth 4 millim.

Hah. rrum, Bugaba (Gkampion).

Many specimens. Allied to 0. marqiniponnis, but differing from it in having the
prothorax entirely caeruleous‚ shorter‚ more declivous in frent (thus appearing less
emarginate)‚ and depressed on either side of the disc, the lateral margins not at‘ all
reflexed; the elytra more rounded at ‚the shoulders. The margins of the elytra are
coarsely punctured iu both species.

Section II. Antennoe with tho Joints less closely articulatod3 first and second ‚
ventral seyments connato or freoly articulated.

1. Prothoraoe emarqinato or truncate in from, tho head moro or less
prominent, usually well exposed.
a. Glaws simple.
To group 1 of this sectiou also belong the South-American genera Cani-stra and
Poeoilaspis, the Antillean genus Elytroqona‚ and the Eastern genus Hoplionota.
