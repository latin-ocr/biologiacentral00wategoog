median vitta on the prothorax; the two flavous vittae on each elytron are sometimes
indistinct from discoloration. C. bullata, Boh., from Brazil, appears to be a closely
allied specieS‚ but has more gibbous elytra.

8. Chelymorpha vittata. (Tab. VII. fig. 3, ῼ .)

ῼ . Ovate, rather broad, somewhat gibbous, slightly shining, glabrous; the head, prothorax, and scutellum
testaceous, the prothorax with a very large subtriangular black patch on either side of the disc; the
elytra flavo-testaceous, each with two very broad black vittae extending almost from the base to near the
apex—one near the suture, narrowed and a little abbreviated posteriorly, the other on the outer part of
the disc, narrowed anteriorly and posteriorly‚ and extending behind the other to near the suture; the
antennas and legs rufo-testaceum, the apical four joints of the antennae infuscate; the under sur-face
blech, the prosternum rufo-testaceous. Head canaliculato between the eyes, the lower part with scattered
rather coarse puncturas ; antennae about reaching the base of the prothorax, the five basal joints shining
and almost smooth. Prothorax more than twice as broad as long, deeply arcuata-emarginate in front,
the sides a little rounded behind, obliquely and more rapidly converging from the middle forwards, the
base bisinuate on either side, the median lobe broad and obtuse, the hind angles a little produced behind 3
the disc with a fine median groove not extending to the apex, sparsely, very finely punctate ; the margins
moderately expanded‚ almost smooth, the outer edge slightly reflexed. scutellum smooth. Elytra
somewhat gibbous anteriorly, about four times as long as, and at the base a little wider than, the prothorax,
widest at one-third from the base, the sides thence to the humeri obliquely converging, the humeri obtuse
and embraced by the hind angles of the prothorax‚ the apices conjointly rounded ; the disc very convex
anteriorly, rather abruptly declivous from about the basal third; the margins moderately expanded and
deflexed ; the entire surface, the sutural region excepted, coarsely‚ thickly punctate. Beneath glabrous‚
smooth, the metapleurae rugose; the prosternum very deeply sulcate for its entire length. Claws
appendiculate.

One specimen, contained in Mr. Ο. Ε. J anson's collection. Allied to O. alternam,
0. rvfipennis‚ &c.‚ but easily separable from these by the very broad black vittae of the
elytra. C. vittata agrees very nearly with the description of O. militaris, Boh. ; but it
has much broader and differently formed elytral vittae, the elytra themselves more
coarsely punctured‚ and, apparently, the hind angles of the prothorax less acuminate.
The vittae in Ο. vittata are nearly twice as broad as the intervening spaces of the ground-
colour.

9. Chelymorpha militaris.
Chelymorpha militaris, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv. p. 204¹.

“ Ovata‚ convexa, testacea, nitida3 antennis extrorsum corporeque subtus nigris ; prothorace sat crebre, sub-'
tiliter punctulat0‚ utrinque macula magna, subtriangulari, nigra ornato, dorso postico longitudinaliter,

tenuiter canaliculat03 elytris sat profunde, minus crebre punctatis, singulo vittis duabus sat latis, nigris
ornat0.--Long. 10, lat. 72} millim.”

Hah. Casum AMsch (Mus. Beroffl).

Unknown to me. 0. militaris is compared by Boheman with, and placed next ιο,
the North-American Ο. arque (Herbst). The elytral vittae are described as ‘⁶ sat latis,
