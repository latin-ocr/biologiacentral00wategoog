This insect is abundant in Mexico and Central America, extending southwards into
the northern part of the South-American continent. Several well-marked forms occur,

all connected by intermediate gradatione :—

α. The elytra each with two transverse or rounded spots placed transversely before the middle3 the spots
subequal in sizo, or the inner spot smaller than the outer one. (Μ. lebasti, Boh.)

β. The elytral spots larger3 the inner spot oblong and often much larger than the outer one, the latter trans-
verse. (Μ. primaria, Boh.) (Fig. 2.)

γ. The elytral spots coalescent on each elytron.

The form α (M. leba-si) is more southern in its distribution than the form β (M. pri·
maria). The form 3 is peculial· to Gnatemala and Nicaragua3 in Guatemala it is
confined to the central plateau and the Pacific slope. The forms β and y are confined
⁸ to the Atlantic slope, and in Mexico and Gnatemala the form α has a similar distri·
bution‚ the first two being almost peculiar to the Mexican State of Vera Cruz.
These three forms all occur at Misantla. From J alapa we have received a specimen of
the form α with the inner spot almost obliterated on one elytron. The form γ closely
resembles some of the varieties of M. salvini, from which it may be known by the
anterior margin of the prothorax not being bordered with testaceous. We figure a
