COPTOCYCLA. 1 97

26. Coptocycla gibbifera. (Tab. X. figg. 23, <33 23 a, profile‘ of ditto23
24, ῼ , var.)

ὁ· . Rounded-triangular, very broad, convex, shining, flavo-testaceous 3 the prothorax with a transverse blank,
castaneous, or ferruginous patch of variable size on the baeal part of the disc—excised on either side and
produced in the middle in front, and with an interrupted testaceous median line, or divided down the
middle, so as to form two sinuous stripes; the scutellum black with a testaceous line down the middle,
or entirely testaceous3 the elytra with the disc black, castaneons, or rufo-testaceous, and with a broad
similarly-coloured ramus extending across the margins to the humeri, the suture anteriorly and some
irregular markings and spots on the disc flavo-testaceous ; the antennas flavo-testaceous, with the apical
joint, and sometimes the tenth also, black3 the legs and under surface flavo-testaceous. Antennae very
elongate and slender, filiform, joint 3 nearly twice as long as 2. Prothorax about twice as broad as long,
with the base deeply sinuato on either side of the broad median lobe and obliquely truncate laterally;
the disc smooth, transversely depressed in the middle at the base; the margins very broadly expanded
laterally and in front, subhyaline, and reticulate. Elytra nearly one-half wider than, and about three
times as long as, the prothorax, very deeply sinuato—emarginato at the base, with the humeri rather
sliarp and greatly produced anteriorly, reaching to a little beyond the middle of the prothorax ; the disc
longitudinally convex, abruptly transversely gibbons below the base, with rows of coarse‚ subapproximate
puncturas, which towards the suture are placed in rather deep striae, the interstices smooth, flat at the
sides, convex towards the suture, and here and there connected by transverse or oblique feebly raised
spaces3 the margins very broadly expanded, gradually becoming narrower towards the apex, smooth and
reticulate, subhyaline from a little below the base, broadly concave before the middle and obliquely
excavato within the humeral angle. Olaws simple.

ῼ . The antennae shorter; the prothorax with the base more rounded towards the sides3 the humeri more
divergent and slightly sinuate externally.

Var. The antennas and prothorax entirely flavo-testaceous3 the elytra flavo-testaceous, faintly variegated with
darker markings, the basal ramus distinct but not reaching the humerus.

Length 7 3—8, breadth 63-73 millim.

Sixteen examples. Following Boheman's arrangement, 0. qibbzfera should be
placed next the Brazilian G. viqens, the only species of the genus described by him
with gibbous elytra and strongly produced humeri. The present species closely
resembles 0¹. asperata, Boh. ; but it has the humeri more produced in front (especially
in the male), the disc of the elytra smoother posteriorly, and the base of the prothorax
more deeply sinuate on either side of the median lobe. 0¹. qibbq‘fera also approaches
those species included in Psalidonota by Boheman. We figure a male from Bugaba,
and a pallid female from ChontaleS.
