male of the typical form from Chiriqui, a female of the var. primaria from Cordova,
and a female of the var. δ from Cerro Zunil.

I have not seen a specimen of this 81100108. Boheman 1 states that M. quadr-motata
resembles M. lebasi at first sight 3 but is smaller, rounder, and more shining, the elytra

somewhat coarsely punctured, with the marginal spot larger and nearer to the exterior
limb‚ and the humeri subangular.

6. Mesomphalia costaricensis. (Tati. VI. fig. 4.)

Broadly cordate, moderately convex; greenish aeneous, caeruleous, or black3 the elytra each with a large
rounded sanguineous or fulvous spot on the exp anded margin before the middle, extending to the outer limit
of the dorsum but not to the lateral margin, and sometimes a minute similarly coloured spot midway
between this and the suture; the antennae black3 the under surface and legs caeruleous or greenish-
aeneous, shining, the former somewhat thickly, the latter sparsely‚ pubescent 3 the prothorax and elytra
(the suture excepted) opaque, almost smooth (minute scattered punctures are visible under a strong lens),
and clothed with very short, scattered semi-erect whitish hairs. Head deeply canaliculat03 antennae
rather elongate, extending to far beyond the base of the prothoraX, the four basal joints shining, the
others opeque. Prothorax twice as broad as long, feebly arcuate-emarginate in frent, widest a little
behind the middle, the sides thence to the apex rapidly, obliquely converging, straight or slightly
converging behind, the base strongly sinuate on either side, and thence to the hind angles nearly straight,
the latter subrectangular, the median lobe obtuse and moderately produced3 the disc with a smooth‚ faint
median line, the lateral portions concave, the apical and lateral margins slightly reflexed. Scutellum
smooth‚ moderately large. Elytra about three times the length of, and one half wider than, the prothorax,
broadly cordate, conjointly rounded at the apex, somewhat obliquely converging behind in the male3 the
disc feebly and regularly convex‚ the su‘ture smooth and shining, and a little raised throughout3 the

margins very broadly expanded, broad-ly ro unded at the shoulders. Beneath sparsely, finely punctured,
the ventral segments also transversely aciculate.

Fisteen 81100110008. Τ1118 108001 has somewhat the facies of an Omaspidea It may
easily be known from the similarly coloured two-spotted variety of M. lebasi by the
almost smooth‚ very dull upper surface, and by the more concave margins of the pro-

thorax. The males are a little shorter than the females, the shoulders being broadly
rounded in both sexes,

‚7 Mesomphalia xanthospila. (Tab.V1. fig. 5, d .)

6 . Subcordate‚ broad, moderately convex3 greenish-aeneous, the anterior margins of the prothorax (except in
the middle) fulvous3 the elytra each with a broad Γ -shaped mark on the middle of the disc at the base,
