corrooYoLA. 217

N umerous examples. This species exactly resembles O. circumnotata, Boh.‚ from
the Amazone, in colour; but differs from it in the more transverse prothorax and the
less deeply emarginate base of the elytra‚ the elytra with the punctures on the middle
of the disc more remote from each other. The annulus on the elytra is usually faint.
In one specimen from Bugaba the apical four joints of the autennae are black above.

A closely allied insect from Brazil (incorrectly labelled Charidotie coqnata, Boh.) is
contained in· the Baly collection.

Some* of the species placed in Charidotis by Boheman have similarly formed antennae.
The shorter annulus on the elytra (when present) will distinguish O. evanescens from
0. proxima.

Boheman's description of this specieS, the type of which is before me, was based
upon a pallid example with the annulus on the elytra obliterated. One of the three
examples found by myself in Gnatemala has the annulus sharply defined, one shows
the outline of it towards the base, and the third resembles the type. ln the first of
these (from Zapote), the prothorax has a broad transverse patch 'in the middle
posteriorly, divided down the centre by a flavous line and not quite reaching the base3
and the elytra have a rather narrow stripe on the outer part of the disc, extending
nearly to the middle and then obliquely converging inwards to the suture, black,
becoming castaneous posteriorly (forming with the marking on the prothorax a
hexagonal annulus), the suture (except at the apex) and the annulus on the inner side
dilute rufescent. The elytra are foveate in the centre before the middle. The antennae
have their third joint not longer than the second. The claws are angularly dilated at
the base. ’

Α specimen from Cache, Costa Rica (Roqers), seems to belong to the pallid variety
of this species ; but it has the ‹liscoidal fovea of the elytra almost obsolete.

We figure two Guatemalan specimens-one (fig. 6) showing the narrow annulus, the
other (fig. 7) agreeing with the type.

7⁶2. coptocycla diluta. (rab. ΧΠ. fig. 8.)

Subrotundate, convex, diluta flavo-testaceous‚ shining; the prothorax with an indistinct transverse dilute
olivaceous patch in the middle before the base, this being divided in the centre ; the elytra with a rather
narrow similarly—coloured annulus on the outer part of the disc, extending round the base to the scutellum
and obliquely converging inwards beyond the middle but not nearly reaching the suture3 the antennae‚
legs, and under surface flavo-testaceous. Antennae moderately long, slender‚ the apical five joints a little
thickened, joint 3 short, not longer than 2, 4 and 5 elongate. Prothorax about twice as broad as long,
broadly expanded at the sides and in front, rather deeply sinuata at the base on either side of the median
