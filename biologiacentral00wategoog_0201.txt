COPTOCYCLA. 185

the broad, truncate median lobe, the disc deeply foveate in the middle before the base, the surface smooth‚

the margins concave in front. Elytra wider than, and nearly three times as long as, the prothorax‚
rounded at the sides, very obtuse behind, and with rounded humeri ; the diso moderately convex, hollowed

behind the humeral callus, with fine, deep, very widely scattered punctures‚ some of which form a row
near the suture, and a deep sutural stria; the margins very broadly expanded‚ becoming narrow at the
apex, with a few seattered punctures‚ separated from the disc by a row of coarser, somewhat closely placed

impressions. Beneath almost smooth3 the prosternum not sulcate. claws simple.
Length 1221, breadth 1οὲ millim.

Hah. N 10ARAGUA, Chontales (Jamon).

One specimen. This species is very closely allied to the Amazonian C. speculata,
Boh., the type ( ῼ) of which is contained in the Baly collection ; but differs from itin
having the scattered punctures on the elytra finer and less numerous, and not black,
those along the outer limit of the disc more closely placed. The elytra are very simi-
larly coloured in the two species3 the prothorax, however, has the broadly expanded

margins flavouS. 0. ὂξῖθπθεΐνα, Boh., from Brazil, is another allied form.

Hah. CENTRAL Annch 1; Pium, Bugaba (Champion).

A single specimen from Chiriqui no doubt represents a variety of this species. It
has the elytra sanguineouS‚ with the suture and base, the exterior limb very narrowly,
and the apical fifth, black, the disc with widely scattered coarse black punctureS, a few
of which are present on the margins; the prothorax with the disc black, with an
angular projection extending from it in the middle in front, and a transverse ramus at

the sides.

Hah. Cos'rA Rch 1.

The type of this species, which we figure, is contained in the Baly collection. This
and the preceding species differ from typical Coptocycla in having the elytra less deeply
emarginate at the base, with the humeri not prominent in front.
