COPTOCYCLA. 189

with the apical four joints piceous or black3 beneath black, the sides of the ventral segments sometimes
rufo-testaceous; the legs varying in colour from rufo-testaceous to nearly black. Antennae scarcely
extending beyond the base of the prothorax, with joints 7-11 rather stout, 3 and 4 elongate, subsqual,
each nearly twice as long as 2, 5 and 6 each shorter than 4, 8-10 almost as broad as long. Prothorax
nearly twice as broad as long, moderately expanded at the sides and in front, deeply sinuato at the base
on either side of the broadly truncated median lohe, the latter unimpressed, the surface almost smooth.
Elytra considerably wider than the prothorax‚ broader in the male than in the female, subparallel nearly
to the middle, deeply sinuata-emarginate at the base z the disc with rows of rather fine subapproximate
puncturas extending to the apex and a deep sutural stria, the interstices smooth, flat: the margins mode-
rately expanded, becoming very narrow at the apex, deflexed, smooth, the outer edge scarcely thickensd 3
the humeri anteriorly prominent, but obtuse. Claws simple.

Length 53-63, breadth 4-43 millim.

Two examples. C. azteca is intermediate as it were between 0. trisz'ynata, Boh., and
its allieS‚ and the North-American Cassida niqrip38, Oliv. In the form of the antennae
it agrees better with Coptooyola than with Cassida. It may be known from 0. niqripes
by its much smaller size, and by the expanded margins of the elytra being much
narrower at the apex, more deflexed, and with the exterior edge scarcely thickened.
The disc of the elytra is very faintly impressed between the anterior spots, but
it cannot be described as foveate. The spots are larger than in C. trisiqnata and
differently placed.

A widely distributed and rather common Tropical-American insect. In this species
the yellow annulus of the elytra is small, not reaching the middle, and followed by a
similarly coloured curved fascia, the rest of the diso, the apex excepted‚ being black,
the prothorax also with a black hasal patch. The antennae are very elongate and
slender, the third joint elongate, joints 6-11 piceous or black,
