UROPLATA. 117

Hah. PANAMA, Volcan de Chiriqui 3000 to Ι4000 feet, Bugaba 800 to 1500 feet
(Champion).

Head very finely granulose, the front only slightly produced between the eyes. Antennae
gradually thickened towards the apeX, rather longer than the head and thorax, robust
in the male, rather more slender in the female; the two lower joints equal, submonili·
form, the third obconic‚ rather shorter than the preceding two united. Thorax trans·
verse3 sides straight and nearly parallel from the base to the middle, sometimes slightly
sinuate‚ thence rotundate-angustate to the apex, the anterior angle arm ed witha strong

· obtuse tooth; disc transversely convex on the sides and apex, broadly depressed and

excavated on its hinder surface, coarsely and strongly foveolate-punctate, the punctures
scattered on the anterior disc, more crowded behind the middle. Elytra oblong3 sides
nearly parallel before the middle, thence gradually dilated to the posterior angle, finely
serrulate, the posterior angle abruptly produced into a flattened subtriangular obtuse
plate; apices obtusely truncate, the marginS, together with the hinder edge of the
lateral plate, coarsely serrate; upper surface opaque‚ finely granulose; each elytron at its
extreme base with eleven, at the extreme apex with six or seven, and on the rest of its
sui-face with ten, rows of punctures; second and fourth interspaces strongly costate,
laterally sinuate‚ the inner costa obsolete at its base3 the basal portion of the sixth,
and the entire eighth interspace, moderately elevated. Legs thickened3 tibiae com·
pressed, the outer edge of the anterior pair subcristate‚ the intermediate pair curved.

This species is nearly allied to, and ‘probably identical with, U. excisa, described in
‚ the present work (antea, p. 111), but without comparison of the types it is impossible
to decide the point.

’ Hah. sz1co1.—Bm11..

Dr. Chapuis haS, I think, given the wrong locality for this species; all the specimens
that I have seen (from various sources) were labelled Brazil.

The three following species are unknown to me :—
