CHARISTENA.—PARAGHALEPUS. 47

impressed on the sides and at the base with large round punctures3 anterior disc nearly
impunctate. Elytra broader than the thoraX, parallel on the sides; lateral margin
entire, the apical margin rounded, emarginate at the suture, finely serrulate; cylindrical,
slightly flattened along the suture ; each elytron with eight, at the base with nine, rows
of deeply impressed large round punctures; second, fourth, and sixth interspaces
costate.

Vertex smooth, impunctate3 front trisulcate; third joint of the antennae longer than
the second, five upper joints slightly thickened. Thorax distinctly longer than broad3
sides obtusely rounded ; subcylindrical, transversely depressed on the hinder disc ; deeply
and closely punctured, the punctures larger and stronger on the middle 3 a space imme-
diately behind the anterior margin nearly fiee from punctures. Elytra broader than
the thorax, parallel on the sides, regularly rounded at the apex, apical margin minutely
serrulate3 upper surface subcylindrical; each elytron with eight, at the extreme base
with nine, rows of deeply impressed punctures; the suture, together with the second,
fourth, and sixth interspaces, costate. Mesofemora with a distinct row of teeth beneath.

The present species may (according to Dr. Horn) be known from G. niqrita, Oliv„ by
the relatively greater length of the third joint of its antennae, by its larger size, by the
different coloration of the upper surface of the body, and lastly by the stronger teeth on
the under surface of the mesofemora3 from 0. fwnesta it is separated by the presence of
these teeth, by the different punctuation of its thorax, and by its strong metallic tint.

The above genus agrees with Ghalepus in all essential characters with one exception-—
the antennae are ten· instead of eleven-jointed. Ι only know a single species, P. brevi-
corm’s from Mexico, and of that only a single specimen.
