HIMATIDIUM. 127

Α very variable insect as regards the maculation of the elytra, and, to some extent,
in the intensity of the punctuation of the prothorax. The different forms may be
particularized thus :—

α. The elytra with numerous black markings on the dorsum—a small spot close to the suture
below the scutellum (sometimes confluent with the one on the opposite elytron) , two spots
or oblique streaks (of variable size) on the disc close to the base, a rounded lateral patch
before the middle, and a broad post· median fascia, the latter with an angular projection

· near the middle of the disc in front, and often confluent externally with the lateral spot,
—and a more or less distinct ante-apical pale yellow fascia 3 the black markings in some
specimens largely extended, forming on the outer part of the dorsum a broad longitudinal
stripe from the post-median fascia forwards, and enclosing two yellow spots. (Fig. 2.)—

Hah. Phuni, Bugaba. Many examples.

β. The black markings much reduced in extent, consisting of five oblong or oblique spots on
each elytron, and a common oblong sutural patch a little beyond the middle. (Fig. 3.)—
Hah. Pinum, Bugaba. One example.

ογ. The elytra with a small or indistinct black spot near the suture below the scutellum and an
oblong larger one between the sixthj and ninth rows of punctures at about one-third
from the base. [H. impurum, Boh., including his var. α. (Fig. 4.)]—Hab. Mnx1co 3
GUATEMALA 3 ΝιοΑιιΑουΑς Βωιι. Five examples seen.

δ. The elytra immaculate 3 the prothorax almost impunctate at the sides and anteriorly. (H. fovei-
colle, Boh.)—Hab. Gonnum. One example.

In some of the specimens of the form δ the scattered punctures on the prothorax
are coarser and more numerouS‚ extending nearer to the anterior angles, The antennae
are sometimes entirely testaceous. The prothorax is deeply transversely excavate on
either side of the disc behind3 and it is strongly plicate near the base, from the median
lobe to the lateral margin, the base of the elytra overlapping that of the prothorax‚ a
character not mentioned by Boheman. Boheman2 gives “Mexico (Salle)’' as the
locality for H. impurum, var. a: Salle’s specimen, marked ‘ type‚' is labelled “San
J uan, Nicaragua.’' In the form ὃ the dark post-median fascia is represented by a
distinctly visible brownish stain. The form α was found in plenty by myself in the
forest region of the ‘⁶ tierra caliente ’' of Chiriqui‚ upon the broad leaves of Heliconiiae.
