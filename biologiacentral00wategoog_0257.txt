PHYTOPHAGA. 241

the second, fourth, and sixth interspaces‚ together with the suture, slightly raised, becoming costato
towards the apex.

Length 13 lin.
Hah. MExlcO, Temax in North Yucatan (Gaumer).

One specimen. The uniform brassy-black colour, short antennae, and peculiar elytral
sculpture distinguish this species at a glauce. ‘Ibe punctures on the elytra form four
double series separated by raised reticulations.

URoPLATA (pp. 92, 123).
Uroplata sanguinipennis (p. 123 ).

Var. The elytra a little shorter, black, with an oblique spot on the shoulders fulvous 3 the head and prothorax
with a brassy lustro.

Hah. MExlco, Atoyac in Vera Cruz (Η. Η. Smitlz).

Two specimens, differing as above from the Panama type. U. sanquinipennis differs
from all the allied forms in having the first to the sixth elytral interspaces narrowly
costate‚

4 (A). Uroplata suloifions. (Ταῦ. X111.fig. 26.)

Moderately elongate, subparallel‚ slightly shining, bleck, the head and prothorax with a slight brassy lustro ;
the prothorax with a fulvous vitta on either side 3 the elytra each with a large fulvous patch extending
from the base to beyond the middle and obliquely truncate behind, the suture piceous or black through-
out; the antennae and legs blaek. Head slightly shining, with some scattered rather coarse punctures
behind, the front moderately produced5 the interocular space with five deep longitudinal grooves.
Antennae nearly half the length of the body, stout, thickening outwardly3 the joints cylindrieal, 3 much
longer than 2, 4 as long as broad, 5-'7 transverse, 8-11 consolidated into a single piece. Prothorax
transverse, moderately eonvex, transversely depressed behind, narrowing from the base, with obtuse
anterior angles 3 the surfaee with very coarse deep scattered punctures, the space on either side occupied
by the fulvous vitta impunctate. Elytra subparallel, a little wider behind than in front, moderately long ;
the sides serrulate to the rounded posterior angle, the apices rather coarsely, unequally serrate, and con-
jointly rounded3 each elytron with eight regular rows of deep punctures throughout3 the second inter-
space broadly and strongly, the fourth moderately, and the sixth finely, costato ; the suture also raised.
Legs moderately long.

Length 23 lin.
Hah. MnxlcO, Temax in North Yucatan (Gaumer).

Three exampleS. Allied to U. vittatipennis, Baly, from Honduras, Nicaragua, &c.,
but less elongate, and with the fourth elytral interspace not so strongly costate‚ the
fulvous patch obliquely truncate behind. In U. vittatipssnnis the third and fourth rows
of punctures are fused into one in the median third of the elytra (not mentioned in the
description); in U. sulmjions they are separate throughout. ⁴

Uroplata coxalgioa (p. 123).
To the Mexican locality given, add z—Teapa in Tabasco (II. H. Smitlz).

One specimen, agreeing perfectly with the type.
