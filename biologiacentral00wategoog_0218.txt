longer than the second. The elytra have three small fuscous or piceous spots—one
just behind the scutellum and one on either side of the suture 8 little lower down; the
suture itself is narrowly 10818000118. An example from Teapa is figured.

38. Coptocycla diophthalma. (Tab. XI. fig. 7. )

Subrotundate, convex, dilute flavous, shining, the margins subhyaline 3 the eyes black3 the prothorax with a
transverse blackish-brown patch at the base, which is excised on either side in front3 the scutellum
blackish-brown ; the elytra with a very large, octagonal, blackish-brown patch on the dise—extending
to considerably beyond the middle and outwardly to the humeral callus, abruptly narrowed behind, and
truncate at the apex,—marked with a small oblong flavous spot on either side of the suture before the
middle, the suture testaceous throughont3 the antennae flavous, with the apical two joints piceous3 the
legs and under surface flavouS. Antennoe rather short and slender, thickening outwardly, extending very
little beyond the base of the prothorax, joints 2 and 3 equal in length, 3 not nearly so stout as 2. Pro-
thorax twice 88 broad as long, broadly expanded and reticulate at the sides and in frent, smooth, the disc
deeply, obliquely grooved at the base on either side of the broad median lobe. Elytra about two and a
half times the length of the prothorax‚ and at thc sides forming almost a continuone outline with it,
moderately deeply emarginate at the base, conjointly rounded at the apex, with the humeri sharp and
prominent3 the disc convex, subremotely seriate-punctate, the punctures (those of the sutural row
excepted) fine towards the suture, closer and much coarser at the sides, and almost obsolete on the flavous
8111081 portion, the interstices quite flat, smooth ; the margins broadly expanded, becoming very narrow
at the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of distantly placed foveae, and deeply
hollowed before the middle internally. Claws simple.

One example only of this peculiarly-coloured small species has been received. It is
allied to O. ὂοηυοαῖσίνί, Βο11., but has more distinctly and less remotely punctured
elytra, and is 8180 very differently coloured. The blackish-brown markings on the
prothorax and elytra form a common octagonal patch, the elytra having the suture
testaceous and a small yellow spot on either side of it before the middle. The punc-
tures of the sutural row are deep 81111 rather widely separated, and they extend 10 1110

apex.

A common insect in Chiriqui. This species has the disc of the elytra olivaceous,
with 8 common yellow annulus before the middle. The antennae are rather short,
with the third joint slender 81111 1101 longer than the second.
