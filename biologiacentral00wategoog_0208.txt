This species is extremely closely allied to 0. amoma, Boh., from which it differs in
the very much broader annulus of the elytra‚ with the enclosed flavous space more
finely and more remotely seriate-punctate; it is also smaller. Boheman’s description
must have been made from a light-coloured example: in most of the numerous
specimens before me the annulus is bordered externally with black (not entirely
sanguineous); and the sutural stripe (as in O. amoena) is dilated below the base,
forming a common ovate spot, which is sometimes partly or entirely black. The
third joint of the antennae is elongate. A specimen from Misantla is figured. The
metamorphoses of this species have been described and figured by Dr. E. Duges (Ann.
Soc. Ent. Belg. 1887, pp. 145, 146, t. 2. figg. 11-13), vsho states that it lives upon
Ipomoea murucoides *.

· 16. Coptocycla tricolorata. (Tab. X. fig. 13.)

Subrotundate‚ convex‚ dilute flavous, shining, the margins subhyaline ; the eyes black3 the prothorax with a
rather narrow, transverse, black or sanguineous patch at the base; the scutellum sanguineous ; the elytra
with a very broad annulus—sanguineous or castanenus, and bordered externally to a greater or less extent
with black, sometimes almost entirely sanguineous—reaching to beyond the middle, obliquely truncate on
either side behind, and extending some distance along the suture towards the apex, and enclosing a
common rounded flavous patch, which is sometimes divided by a very narrow dilute sanguineous sutural
stripe3 the antennae flavous, with the apical joint slightly infuscata at the tip3 the legs and under
surface flavous. Antennae moderately long, slender‚ the apical five joints a little thickened‚ · joint 3 much
longer than 2. Prothorax about twice as broad as long, broadly expanded and reticulate at t-he sides and
in frent, smooth, the disc obsoletely canaliculate before the base and very faintly depressed on either side
of the median lobe. Elytra nearly three times the length of the prothorax, and much wider than it,
deeply sinuata-emarginate at the base, conjointly rounded at the apex, with prominent humeri ; the disc
convex, deeply foveate before the middle, and hollowed at the sides behind the humeral callus, with a deep
sutural stria posteriorly‚ rather remotely seriate—punctate‚ the punctures fine towards the suture, coarse
and deep at the sides, and almost obsolete on the flavous apical portion, the interstices smooth and flat3

the margins very broadly expanded, becoming gradually narrower towards the apex, smooth and reticulate,
separated from the disc by a row of closely placed foveae. Claws simple.

Length 52-6‡‚ breadth 42-53 minim.

'l'en specimenS. This insect is very closely allied te, and perhaps only a variety of,
C. opulenta, Boh.; from which it differs in having the discoidal flavous patch on the
elytra entirely yellow, or with the suture, at most (even in the darkest specimens), very
