34 PHYTOPHAGA.

the hinder one just behind the middle), one on the sixth (halfway between its middle
and the apex), and, lastly, two on the eighth (the first elongate, near the middle, the
second shorter, subapical); the two ridges on the humeral callus cover, one nearly the

basal half of the sixth, the other the basal fourth of the eighth interspaces.
This and the preceding species ought to be placed near 0. marqinata, Guer.

3. Cephalodonta godmani. (Tab.11.figg. 16, 17.)

Sannadrata, postico paullo ampliata, pallide flava, nitida3 capite (antennis exceptis), thorace scutelloque rufo-
fulvis3 pectore fulvo ; thorace transverso, ante medium abrupte constricte, lateribus medio acute angu-
latis3 elytris late explanatis, rufis, punctato-striatis, striis gemellatis, nigris, limbo externo (hoc rufo bi-
maculato)‚ fascia irregulari prope medium, ad limbum ampliata [nec non callo longitudino-li baseos] prope
suturam albidis ; callo humerali lateraliter producto, ac to.

Mas. Tibiis anticis intus ante apicem dente brevi armatis.

ΡΜ. Α (nm). Antennis apice fuscis3 thorace latiori, sordide flavo; elytris flavis, spatiis inter costas ruic-
fulvis.

Long. 5-6 lin.

Hah. NICARAGUA, Chontales (Belt); PANAMA, Pefia Blanca 3000 to 4000 feet (Cham-
χήρη, var. A).

Face between the antennae with an acute tooth. Antennae rather more than half the
length of the body, filiform; joints cylindrical‚ the two lower ones short, equal. Thorax
twice as broad as long in the medial line, its anterior portion abruptly contracted to
nearly half its width; sides straight and obliquely diverging from the base to the
middle, thence to the apex entirely occupied by a deep angular notch, the anterior
border of which is nearly perpendicular and forms the lateral margin of the constricted
half of the thorax, whilst the hinder border is horizontal and runs directly outwards to
form an acute angle with the oblique hinder portion of the margin; apical angle armed
with a stout subacute tooth3 upper surface transversely excavated at the base,
impressed, but rather sparingly, with large irregular punctures, medial disc nearly
impunctate. Elytra much broader than the thorax; sides broadly dilated, obtusely
rounded, posterior angle not produced, obtusely angulate, apical margin obliquely
rounded; upper surface flattened between the humeral calli, the latter strongly
produced laterally, their apices acute; each elytron with ten longitudinal rows of deep
punctures, arranged in pairs, the inner pair abbreviated at the base, the space being
occupied by an irregular longitudinal callosity, which extends downwards from the
basal margin for nearly one fourth the length of the elytron3 the suture, together with
the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth interspaces‚ costate; rufous, the interspaces between
the costae black; the outer limb, an irregular fascia [dilated on the outer margin] just
behind the middle, together with the basal callus, white3 the outer limb has two
large rufous patches, attached by their inner edges to the disc, and extending
outwardly nearly to the lateral margin, of these one is placed before, the other

behind the middle.
