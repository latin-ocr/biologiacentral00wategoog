208 PHYTOPHAGA.

Cerro Zunil, and also at other places in Gnatemala‚ these specimens varying
in the colour of the under surface—from entirely testaceous or rufo-testaceous
(0. tuberculata) to rufo-testaceous with the prosternal process, the apical half of the
metasternum (except at the sides), the basal half of the fifth ventral segment‚ and
the base of the femora beneath black. The elytra (in dried examples) vary in
*colour from a dilute vermilion-red to flavo-testaceous3 the margins have a large
oblong flavo-hyaline space before the middle. Boheman's specimens of all three
forms have been examined‚ one of which (his tuberculata) is figured. The closely
allied Ο. rubicunda, Boh.‚ from Brazil‚ differs from the present species in having the
elytral margins coarsely punctured at the base. The third joint of the antennae is
elongate in both species. The Costa Rican specimens have the punctures on the
elytra coarser than usual. The smallest examples measure 7 millim. only in length,
the largest 10 millim. The locality ‘⁶ Sierra Leone '⁹ quoted by the older authors ¹-3 is
of course a mistake.

This also is a common Central-American insect. It is perhaps only a variety of
C. tuberculum, frorn which it differs in its rather smaller size‚ and in having the
elytral margins subhyaline posteriorly (not stained with rufo-testaceous in their apical
. two-fifths‚ as in 0. tuberculata). 0. ventricosa has been collected in numbers at
Teapa and Misantla, and it is quite constant in those localities; but some of the
Chiriqui specimens are intermediate.

Var. β. The dark markings on the elytral margin almost obliterated, a faint curved line limiting the
triangular antemedian hyalino patch anteriorly alone visible, the margins thence to the apex subhyaline.

Hah. PANAMA, Volcan de Chiriqui (Clzampion). Two specimens.
