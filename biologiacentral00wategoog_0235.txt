COPTOCYCLA. 219

t-he anterior border of the humerus,·—a transverse or oblique mark on the inner part of the margin about
the middle, two small spots on the onter part of the disc—the anterior one oblong and in a line with the
discoidal fovea, the posterior one at the middle,—-a small spot on the discoidal fovea, and the sutural edge
very narrowly, black or blackish ; the antennae testaceouS, with the apical five joints black a beneath black‚
the sides of the prothorax and of the abdomen testaceous ; the legs testaceous. Antennoe elongate,
extending far beyond the base of the prothorax, joints 3-6 slender, 7-11 thicker than those preceding,
3 very little longer than 2. Prothorax twice as broad as long, smooth, slightly depressed at the base on
either side of the broad median lobe, broadly expanded and reticulate at the sides and in front. Elytra
very much wider than, and about three times as long as, the prothorax‚ sinuate-emarginate at the base 3
the disc strongly transversely convex anteriorly and somewhat abruptly declivous beyond, very deeply
foveate in the centre before the middle and longitudinally depressed at the sides below the humeral callus,
very finely and rather remotely seriata-punctam, the punctures becoming coarser towards the sides, the
interstices smooth and flat; the margins broadly expanded, becoming narrow at the apex, smooth, reti-
culate, separated from the diso by a row of coarse foveae, subhyaline from a little below the base3 the
humeri prominent anteriorly, obtuse. Claws angularly dilated at the base.

Var. The transverse humeral patch faint or diluta, the other elytral markings partly or entirely obliterated.

Length 6-63‚ breadth 5-52 millim.

Hah. PANAMA, Bngaba, Volcan de Chiriqui (Champion).

Numerone examples. This species is perhaps nearest allied to 0. profliqata, Boh. ;
but it is much larger and more convex, and the elytra are relatively wider anteriorly,
with more prominent humeri and a deeper discoidal fovea. The elytra are almost
gibbous below the base.

75. coptoeyela duplex. (Tab. X11.figg. 113 11 a, prome.)

Subtriangular, very convex, shining, rufo· or flavo-testaceous, the elytra with a broad ramus of this colour at
the base extending across the margins to the humeri; the dilated margins of the prothorax, and those of
the elytra from a little below the base, flavo-hyaline; the antennoe flavo-testaceous‚ with the apical four
joints (the tip of the eleventh excepted) black3 the legs and under surface flavo-testaceons. Antennae
moderately long, the five outer joints thicker than those preceding, joint 3 a little longer than 2 and
shorter than 4. Prothorax nearly twice as broad as long, moderately sinuato at the base on either side
of the broad median lobe, the latter obliquely grooved at the sides and with a few fine puncturas ς the
margins broadly expanded. Elytra very much wider than, and about three times the length of, the pro-
thorax, narrowing from the base, the base rather deeply emarginate, the humeri prominent, obtuse; the
disc very convex, rather abruptly declivous posteriorly‚ deeply foveate in the centre before the middle and
bifoveate at the base, hollowed at the sides behind the humeral callus, with rows of widely separated fine
puncturas, which are sometimes fuscous in colour, the interstices smooth and flat3 the margins moderately
expanded, becoming very narrow at the apex, smooth and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of
deep foveae. Claws angularly dilated at the base.

Length 6433, breadth 5-5ὲ millim.

Hah. ΜΕΧΙΟΟ, Tapachula in Chiapas (Hb'qe) ; GUMEMAM, Las Mercedes (Champion).

Three examples, all from the Pacific slope, and from not very distant localitieS.
This species resembles 0. υθηΐνίσοεα, Boh.; but it is much smaller and the elytra are

not abruptly gibbous. From the somewhat similarly-coloured 0. prqfh‘qata, Boh.‚ it

may be known by its larger size, subtriangular shape‚ and more gibbous elytra, the
latter much more deeply foveate on the disc.
