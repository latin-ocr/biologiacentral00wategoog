This insect is probably nothing more than a local variety of 0. plicata,-th0ugh it
is widely separated from that species in Boheman's Monograph,—from which it differs
in having the inner part of the elytral margins from the base to the middle, as well as
the entire diso, black. The scutellum is usually black, sometimes partly yelloW. . The
black on the elytral margins is broadest at the middle, showing no tendency to extend
outwards at the base (the converse being the case in 0. cicili), the rest of the margin
being clear flavo-hyalino. Sent in plenty from Teapa, in company with 0. 8ὑᾶΖί and
0. plicata. Boheman 1-3 also quotes New Granada (Colombia) as a locality ; but his
Colombian specimens probably belong to' O. rubrocincta‚ as here understood.

This is one of several closely allied forms named by Boheman as distinct species, and
which merely differ inter se in slight details of coloration; but as these forms are fairly
constant I have retained them as distinct. The elytra in 0. plicata have a large, black,
parallel-sided patch occupying nearly the whole of the disc, the black not extending on
to the margins about the middle as in 0. melanota, nor emarginate laterally and with
the black extending on to the margins before and behind the emargination as in
(ι’. stabi. The scutellum is flavous in the numerous Mexican specimens received, black
in the two from Chiriqui. The prothorax has a very large, triangular, black patch
occupying nearly the whole of >the disc. Pallid examples have the dark parts casta·
neous. Boheman also gives 1-3 North America as a locality, but the insect is not
known to me from north of the Mexican State of Vera Cruz.
