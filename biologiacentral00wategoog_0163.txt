MESOMPHALIA.—-CHELYMORPHA. 147

outer part of the disc (in 8 line with the end of the humei-al mark and sometimes extending to about one-
third from the apex), black ς antennae black, the five hasal jointe pale testaceous, 2-5 more or less stained
with piceous above3 the under surface and legs pale testaceous, the tibiae on their outer edge and the
tarsi black. Head‚ antennae, prothorax, scutellum, and elytra 88 18 Μ. niyrolineata, the prothorax with
very minute scattered puncturas at the sides, the apex as viewed from above truncate.

Length, d , 822—9, breadth 73—83 millim.; ῼ , length 9Ξ-1οΞ, breadth 8-8} millim.

Hab. Cos'rA R1cA‚ Cache (Roqers).

Three males and two femaleS. Closely allied to, and probably only a variety of,
M. niqrolineata‚ from which it differs in having the suture black for a short distance
below the scutellum only (the black not quite reaching the base), the fine black streak

on the outer part of the disc of each elytron abbreviated and interrupted‚ and the
elytral margins not bordered with black.

CHELYMORPHA.

Glaelymmpha (Chevrolat)‚ Dej. cat. 3rd edit. p. 393 (1837); Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 1
(1854) (partim).
Gyphomorpha, Hope, Col. Man. iii. p. 160 (1840).

This genus is readily recognizable by the base of the prothorax being so deeply
emarginate on either side externally 88 to make the hind angles, which are acute or
sharp‚ appear as if they were produced behind, the prothorax being also emarginate to
a greater or less extent in front. Amongst other characters given by Boheman are
“ the prosternum deeply, longitudinally canaliculate,” and “ the claws unidentate at
the base beneath.” Three of his specieS‚ 0. punctipennis‚ 0. cpiam, and 0. obducta,
all from S. America‚ do not possess these peculiarities‚ nor have they the prothorax
emarginate in front; and I propose to separate them under the name Oistudinella,
including in the same genus an allied species from the State of Panama‚ which is dealt
with below, Upwards of one hundred species of Chelymmplza have been described‚
all American, ranging from the United States to Patagonia and occurring also in the
Antilles ; twenty-four are here recorded from within our limits as against two from the
United States. The genus is one of the most characteristic of the Central·American
Cassididae ; 0. juvenca and its 811188 11881· 8 remarkable resemblance to some of the
species of Epilaclma of the family Coccinellidae inhabiting the same region. The
following Table is added to assist in the identification of the Central-American 8988188,
but it must be remembered that some of them are very variable in colour.

Elytra strongly gibbous anteriorly, the suture usually more or less raised below
the 11888, 80 88 to form a hump; upper surface thickly pubescent.

Species large, very coarsely punctured above ........... hepher-i, Boh.
Species smaller, more finely punctured above.
Elytra with several distinct spots, including a common sutural one . . . pubescens, Boh.,

messoria, Boh.
Elytra immaculate or nearly so .............. sericea, Boh.
