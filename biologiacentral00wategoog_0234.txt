218 PHYTOPHAGA.

lobe; the diso almost smooth, feebly obliquely grooved on either side of the median lobe at the base; the
margins subhyaline and reticulate. Elytra much wider than, and about three times as long as, the pro-
thorax, rather deeply sinuato-emarginate at the base, with rounded not very prominent humeri; the disc
convex, somewhat deeply foveate in the centre before the middle, with rows of very fine widely separated
punctures, which become almost obsolete towards the apex, the interstioes smooth and flat3 the margins
broadly expanded, becoming narrow at the apex, smooth, reticulate, and subhyalim, separated from the
disc by a row of not very deep foveae. Claws angularly dilated atthe base.

Length 6, monath 5 mfflim.
Hah. N manaem, Chontales (Janson).

One specimen, contained in Mr. Ο. Ε. J anson's collection. The narrow dilute
olivaceous annulus on the elytra, extending round the base to the scutellum and
obliterated posterior-ly, will distinguish this obscure species from 0. virqulata and other

allied forms.

73. Coptocycla sinuata. (Tab. XII. fig. 9.)

Rounded-triangular, convex, shining, flavo-testaceous; the elytra each with three diluto fuscous spots on the
disc—two placed transversely at about one-fourth from the base (one in the discal fovea, the other at the
side) and one at the side a little below the middle‚—and a similarly-coloured broad curved stripe on the
margin, extending round the base in front (but not reaching the anterior edge) and partly hiding a
broad flavo-testaceous fascia, obliquely converging inwards about the middle, and thence narrowly
continued along tho outer part of the disc to the apex, the suture very narrowly edged with black3 the
antennae flavo-testaceous, with the apical five joints black ς beneath black, the protborax at the sides, and
the abdomen with the sides very broadly, and the apex of each segment narrowly, flavo-testaceous ς the
legs testaceous, the intermediate and hind femora blaok, except at the apex. Antennae elongate, slender,
the apical five joints thickened‚ joint 3 slightly longer than 2 and much shorter than 4. Prothorax
about twice as broad as long, moderately sinuate at the base on either side of the median lobe, smooth,
broadly expanded at the sides and in front, the margins reticulate and subhyaline. Elytra very much
wider than, and more than three times as long as, the protborax, moderately emarginate at the base, with
very prominent rather obtuse humeri; the disc strongly convex, deeply foveate in the centre at about
one-fourth from the base, shallowly bifoveate at the base, and hollowed at the sides behind the humei-al
callus, with rows of exceedingly fine remote punctures‚ which on the median third become coarser at the
sides, the interstices smooth and flat; the margi ns broadly expanded, becoming narrow at the apex,
smooth and reticulate, subhyaline from a little below the base (except on the dark curved stripe), and
separated from the disc by a row of deep foveae. Claws angularly dilated at the base.

Length η, breadth δὲ minim.
Hah. Nummum, Chontales (Belt).

One specimen. This species somewhat resembles 0. eqreqia, Boh.'; but the elytra
are not gibbous anteriorly, the discoidal fovea is deeper, and the curved sinuous stripe

on the margins is very differently shaped, it extending obliquely inwards about the
middle and then continued along the outer edge of the disc to the apex. There is
apparently a broad flavo-testaceous fascia extending across the margins to the humeri,

but it is hidden by the fuscous stripe. ¹

74. Coptocycla scapularis. (Tab.X11. fig. 10.)

Rounded-triangnlar, rather broad, strongly convex, shining3 flavo-testaceous, the elytra with a transverse
patch on the margin at the base-—extending narrowly inwards along the basal margin, but not reaching
