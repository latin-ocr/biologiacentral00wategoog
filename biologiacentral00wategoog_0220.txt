204 PHYTOPHAGA.

We have received three specimens only of this species. 0. distorta closely resembles
0. dohrni, Boh., but differs from it in its smaller size, and in having the margins of the
elytra rugulosely punctured. The elytra have a small transverse or oblong blackish
spot on the suture before the middle. The antennae (which were mutilated in the
specimen described by Boheman) have the apical joint, and the outer half of the
preceding one, black; the third joint is not longer than the second.

44. Coptooycla biannulifera. (T ab. XI. figg. 12; 12 a, antenna.)

Rotundate, convex, flavous, shining, the margins subhyaline; the eyes, and a narrow transverse patch at the
base of the prothorax, black; the scutellum flavous 3 the elytra with a narrow black stripe on the outer
part of the disc, extending obliquely inwards a little beyond the middle and curved behind, and forming
(with the mark at the base of the prothorax) an octagonal annulus, which is broadly bordered with dilute
sanguineons within, and encloses a common flavous rounded patch ; the antennae testaceous, with the apical
two joints slightly infuscate ς the legs and underside testaceous, Antennae short, scarcely extending beyond
the base of the prothora‘x‚ slender, the apical five joints a little thickened, joint 3 shorter and thinner than 2,
4 twice as long as 3. Prothorax nearly twice as broad as long, very broadly dilated and reticulate at the
sides and in frent, the disc feebly depressed at the base on either side of the broad median lobe, and with a
few fine scattered punctures behind. Elytra about two and a half times as long as the prothorax, and at the
sides forming almost a continuous outline with it, conjointly rounded at the apex, strongly bisinuate at the
base, and with the humeri subacute and prominent in front3 the disc convex, hollowed behind the humeral
callus, with regular rows of fine, light-ly impressed, rather remotely placed punctures, the interstices

smooth and quite flat; the margins very broadly expanded, becoming narrow at the apex, smooth and

reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of deep foveae. Claws simple.
Length 7 ἦ, breadth 63 millim.

Hah. PANAMA, Volcan de Chiriqui 3000 feet (Champion).

One example, probably of the male sex, Closely allied to Charidotistiroulvfera,
Boh., the type of which is before me ; but differing from it in the very much narrower

black annulus (common to the prothorax and elytra), the shorter antennae, and the
still finer seriate punctures of the elytra, the median lobe of the prothorax very faintly
depressed on either side at the base (deeply, obliquely grooved in 0. circulffera).
Notwithstanding the short antennae, the species seems to me to be best placed in

Coptocycla‚ near Ο. circumducta, 0. incincta, &c. A closely-allied undescribed species
from the Amazons is contained in the Baly collection.

45. Goptocycla incincta. (Tab. XI. figg. 13; 13 a, antenna.)
Coptocycla incincta, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv. p. 422 ¹.

Ηαό. PANAMA, Bugaba (Champion).—AMA20NS, Ega 1.

One specimen from Chiriqui, differing from the type of C. incincta in the Baly
collection in having the antennae slightly longer and almost entirely testaceous, the
punctures on the elytra coarser, and the annulus a little broader. This is one of
several extremely closely allied species (0. conomtrica, Ο. cinctio-ulus, 0. consimilis, and
0. siqnoreti, Boh.), some of which appear to have been described from single specimens,
differing chiefly inter se in the form of the antennoe and in the elytral punctuation.
