Antennae half the length of the body, filiform, slightly attenuated at base and apex 3
joints cylindrical, two lower ones short, equal‚ the basal one very slightly thickened‚
third joint nearly equal in length to the preceding two united3 five outer ones black,
the rest fulvous3 in some specimens the antennae are almost entirely black, the two or
three lower joints being alone fulvous. Thorax twice as broad as long; sides narrowly
reflexed, straight and nearly parallel from the base to below the middle, thence rounded
and converging to the apex; apical angle anteriorly produced, obtuse; disc nitidous,
very sparingly impressed with deep punctures. Elytra broader than the thoraX, sub-
quadrate, obtusely rounded at the apex, conjointly emarginate at the sutural angle;
upper surface moderately conveX, obsoletely gibbous behind the scutellum, regularly
punctate-striate, the punctures sometimes piceous.

Ι have placed this species in the present genus with some doubt ; it has the labium
formed as in Cephaloleia, but. with the broad form and the short basal joint to the
antennae as in Hemalispa.

Head closely punctured3 face between the antennae with an elevated longitudinal
ridge. Antennae with the basal joint subclavate, the second oblong-ovate, two thirds
the length of the first, the third about equal in length to the basal one. Thorax about
one fifth broader than long ; sides straight and parallel, rounded and converging at the

extreme apex, the anterior angle produced, obtuse ; upper surface transversely convex, ·
. smooth and shining‚ deeply impressed with large round punctures3 a narrow medial

line on the disc nearly free from ptmctureS. Elytra subelongate, moderately convex3
sides parallel, apices (conj oin tly) obtusely rounded3 upper surface strongly punctate-
striate; flavous3 a sutural vitta, gradually narrowed towards the apex, nigro-picenus.
