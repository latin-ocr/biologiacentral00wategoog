7 6 PHYTOPHAGA.

slightly produced, obtuse. Antennoe about one third the length of the body, rather
slender below the middle, slightly thickened towards the apex: joints cylindrical.
Thorax transverse3 sides rounded, nearly straight and parallel from the base to the
middle, thence deeply sinuate and obliquely converging towards the apex, the anterior
angle produced into a subacute tooth ; disc transversely conveX, transversely excavated
behind the middle, closely and coarsely punctured. Elytra broader than the thorax,
parallel, regularly rounded at the apex, the latter, together with the lower portion of
the sides, faintly serrulate; each elytron with ten regular rows of large deep punctures,
the suture, together with the second and fourth interspaces, costate, the eighth less
distinctly elevated.

Hah. ommium, Sinanja in Vera Paz (Champion).

Head smooth and shining; front moderately produced, its surface with an ill-defined
rufo-piceous patch ; on either side, running along the inner border of the eye, is a deep
longitudinal groove. Antennae about one third the length of the body, filiform, not
thickened at the apex; joints cylindrical, the first and second short, equal in length,
ovate, the basal one slightly thickened, the third joint nearly half as long again as the
second. Thorax about one fourth broader than long at the base; sides straight and
very slightly diverging from the base to the middle, thence obliquely converging to the
apex, anterior angle armed with a short oblique tooth; subcylindrical, flattened and
broadly excavated on the hinder disc, closely covered with foveolate punctures; the
lateral margin, together with a narrow discoidal vitta (the latter not extending to the
apical margin and also sometimes abbreviated at the base), black. Elytra narrowly
oblongoelongate, parallel, the sides finely serrulate, the apex obtuse-ly rounded3 upper
surface convex on the sideS, flattened along the suture; each elytron with ten regular
rows of large deep punctures, the suture, together with the second and fourth inter-
spaces, distinctly and equally costate, the eighth less strongly elevated.
