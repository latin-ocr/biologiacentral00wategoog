HoMALIsPA. n ⁷

the outer disc sulcate, their interspaces thickened‚ here and there distinctly costate3
outer limb reflexed, its surface concave, impunctate.
In coloration this species strongly resembles many species of Hemalispa.

HOMALISPA.
Homalt'spa, Baly, Cat. Hispidae, p. 33.
The present genus, apart from the structural differences of the mouth and antennae‚

may be known from Cephaloleia by the broader and more ovate form. With the excep-
tion of the two described here the species inhabit the warmer parts of South America3

about a dozen species are known.

1. Romalispa variabilis. (Ταῦ. 1. fig. 9.)

Anguste oblongo-ovata, depressa, nitida3 subtus nigra, pectoris medio nigro-piceo, thorace inferiori capiteque
flavis3 supra flava, antennis, capitis vertice scutelloque nigris ; thorace laevi, utrinque late excavato, vitta
lata discoidali nigra ; elytris oblongis, distincte punctam-sumtis, dimidio postico vittaque late saturali nigr'n.

ναν. Α. Elytris flavis, vitta suturah’ pone medium obsoleta.

Hah. PANAMA, Volcan de Chiriqui 3000 feet (Ohampion).

Lower face excavated, concave; vertex impressed with a few fine punctures. Antennae
more than half the length of the body, filiform, very slightly attenuated at the base and
apex; joints cylindrical, the second half the length of the basal one, the third as long
again as the second. Thorax twice as broad as long at the base; sides very oblique,
quickly converging from base to apeX, straight behind the middle, slightly rounded
anteriorly, apical angle produced, subacute‚ the hasal one very acute; basal margin
broadly concave, emarginate on either side, its medial portion very obtusely rounded
and slightly reflexed; upper surface smooth and shining, remotely impressed with very
fine punctureS, only visible under a strong lens; medial disc covered with a broad black
vitta, which extends from base to apex3 surface between this discoidal vitta and the
lateral margin excavated, the lateral margin itself reflexed. Elytra rather broader than
the base of the thorax; sides straight, nearly parallel, apical margin (conj ointly)
obtusely rounded3 the outer border very finely serrulate, serratures distant on the
side8‚ closer at the apex3 each elytron with eleven rows of distinct punctureS‚ the first
row short; outer striae subsulcate, their interspaces slightly conveX.

This specie& of which I have seen five specimen& all collected by Mt. Ohampion, is
very variable in pattern, and in the extent of the black coloration of the elytra.

2. Romalispa limbifera.

Late ovata, depressa, flava, nitida3 scutello antennisque nigris, abdomine pallide pice03 thorace kevi, ad latera
sparse foveolato-punctato, disco plaga magna nigra, -cuneiformzi, a basi ad apicem producta instructo3
elytris sat fortiter pmctato·striatis; piceo-nigris, limbo exteriori late flavo.

Long. 2 lin.
