With a long series of specimens it is impossible to separate Τ. coeruleopunctata from
Τ. casta, the types of which are before me. Typical Τ. coeruleopunctata have the
elytra more sparsely punctured and the interspaces less coriaceous, but intermediate
forms occur. The colour is variable, as is also the length of the humeral process of
the elytra. Of the variety two specimens only have been seen. Τ. coeruleopunctata is
doubtfully recorded by Boheman ² as from New Orleans‚ which is evidently a mistakeg
the specimen in the Baly collection named by him 2 is from Gnatemala. Fig. 13 is
taken from the type of T. casta, fig. 14 from that of Τ. cmleopunctata.

This insect is much more shining than Τ. casta, and it has the prothorax as well as
the elytra coarsely punctured‚ the punctures on the elytra much more numerous, The
single specimen from Costa Rica has the humeral process more elongate, and the
suture more raised below the base. The locality quoted by Chevrolat ¹ is “ Toulepeck.''

One species only of this genus, which contains some familiar and abundant Brazilian
insectS‚ is known to me as yet from within our limits. Desmonota is sunk by Chapuis
as a subgenus of Τ auroma. It is exclusively confined to Tropical America, just

entering our southern limits.
