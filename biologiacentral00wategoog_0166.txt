Var. a. The prothorax usually with the sides, the base and apex in the middle, and two transversely placed
spots on the disc, black 3 the elytra with a common, ovate, rather large spot on the suture below the base,
a small spot on the humeral callus, and sometimes one or two other small spots on the disc or margin,

black, the exterior limb also more or less infuscata or black3 the legs entirely black.

Var. β. The sides and apex, and sometimes also the base, of the prothorax and the exterior limb of the elytra
rufo-testaceous ; the legs partly or entirely black.

It is with some hesitation that Ι retain 0. qressoria as distinct from 0. pubescens;

but as the elytra appear to be more gibbou8‚ and the insect is constant in some localitie8‚
though occurring with 0. pubescens in otherS‚ it is perhaps advisable to keep them
separate. The sutura] callosity of the elytra is larger and more rounded than in
C. pubescens, and the spots between the humeral callus and the suture show no tendency
to become confluent, so as to form an oblong patch. The prothorax‚ the anterior
margin and a small oblong spot on the disc excepted‚ and the legs are sometimes
black. The colour of the prothorax is very variable. 0. qressoria has been collected
rather abundantly at Las Mercedes in Gnatemala‚ and at various places in Chiriqui,
unaccompanied by 0. pubescens, which apparently does not extend south of Guate-

mala. We figure one of Boheman’s types from J uquila, a male.

Ι have seen only four specimens of this species, including the types in the Baly
collection. Three of these belong to the variety with immaculate elytra. We figure

Boheman's type.
