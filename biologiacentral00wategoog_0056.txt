to the apex, bisinuate, distinctly angulate3 upper surface closely rugose·punctate,.
obsoletely torulose on the sides and apex. Elytra as in 0. erudita.

Very nearly allied to 0. erudita and found at the same localities3 it is possibly the
male of that species. I have thought it well, however, to consider it distinct, chiefly
owing to the different form of the discoidal vitta on the thorax, and also to the different
relative lengths of the three lower joints of the antennae.

Vertex. smooth, impunctate3 front impressed with a few deep punctures, the medial
line with a longitudinal groove. Antennae more than half the length of the body3 the
two lower joints cylindrical, the basal one short, the second slightly longer, the third to
the seventh compressed, quadrilateral, the third and fourth nearly equal, each longer
than the two lower ones united, the fifth to the seventh gradually decreasing in length;
four upper joints eylindrical, closely clothed with adpressed hairs. Thorax not broader
than long; sides nearly parallel at the base, obtusely angulate behind the middle,
thence converging and sinuate to the apeX, and the anterior angle armed with an oblique,
subacute, setiferous tooth3 above transversely convex, broadly excavated on the hinder*
disc, closely covered with large foveolate punctures. Elytra broader than the thorax5
sides nearly paraUel, slightly enlarged towards the hinder angle [the latter dilated
laterally into a triangular spinose process, the apex of which is produced directly back--
wards, its outer margin being conveX, and its hinder one concave], irregularly serrulate,
and edged with nigro-piceous3 each elytron with ten, at the extreme base with eleven,
rows of large deep punctures; the fourth interspace from the suture costate.
