188 PHYTOPHAGA.

8. Coptocycla orbiculata. (Tab. X. fig. 3.)

Almost circular, very convex, shining, flavo-testaceous3 the elytra with a very broad, indeterminate, dilute
olivaceous annulus—extending round the outer part of the disc and reaching the suture at the base,
—which is indistinotly bordered within and without- with yellow, and encloses a common dilute
ferruginous patch at the middle and a smaller one near the apex, these latter reticulated with flavous and
nan-owing outwardly, the anterior one with a small flavous spot in the centre, the suture narrowly ferru-
gineus3 the antennae and legs testaceous3 the under surface black, with the sides and the abdomen flavo-
testaeeous. Antennae rather short, comparatively stout‚ thickening outwardly, joints 3 and 4 equal in
length, 3 nearly twice as long as 2. Prothorax subtriangular in shape, the base very feebly sinuate and
oblique on either side of the median lobe; the disc smooth, transversely depressed in the middle at the
base3 the margins broadly expanded laterally and in frout, subhyaline, and reticulate. Elytra circular,
forming almost a continuone outline with the prothorax and deeply emarginate at the base for its recep-
tion, with rather sharp humeri3 the disc very convex, somewhat gibbous anteriorly, with rows of widely
separated, rather coarse, deep punctures‚ which become much finer at the base and almost obsolete beyond
the middle (the sutural row excepted), the interstices smooth and flat; the margins greatly expanded,
becoming narrower at the apex, smooth, reticulate, and subhyaline, separated from the disc by a row of

deep foveae. Claws simple.
Length δῇ, breadth 6 millim.

Hah. PANAMA, Bugaba (Champion).

One example only of this curious species has been obtained. It is perhaps nearest

allied to C. placida, Boh., from Cayenne. The elytral markings are perhaps partly
due to discoloration. The general outline is almost circular, resembling Platycycla,

the elytra being deeply emarginate at the base for the reception of the prothorax.

Vera Paz (Champion).

Apparently confined to the lower parts of the Atlantic slope. This species may be
known by its convert, subrotundate shape ; the elytra very deeply emarginate at the base,
with the sides forming almost a continuone outline with the prothorax; the antennae
rather stout, and extending very little beyond the base of the prothorax, the third and
fourth joints equal in length, each very much longer than the second. The femaleS,
as usual, are more elongate than the males.

The type from the Stockholm Museum is figured.

10. Coptocycla azteca. (Tab. IX. fig. 15, ῼ .)

Short ovate (ὅ ), ovate ( ῼ ), convex, shining, rufo-testaceous or testaceous‚ the expanded margins of the pro—
thorax dilute yellow, the scutellum more or less infuscate, the elytra each with three large diluto fuscous
spots—one, rounded, before the middle, ou the fourth and fifth interstices, one, oblong, below the humeral
callus, and one, oblique, between the seventh and ninth interstices near the apex ; the anteunae testaceous‚
