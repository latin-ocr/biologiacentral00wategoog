OEPHAmLEIA, 17

Front finely but not closely punctured. Antennae black or nigro-piceous, filiform‚
moderately robust3 first and third joints equal in length, the second rather shorter.
Thorax quadrate3 sides straight and parallel, anterior angle distinctly produced, obtuse;
upper surface strongly punctured‚ a longitudinal space on the middle disc impunctate3
apical margin, together with the anterior angles, narrowly piceous. Elytra narrowly
oblong, flattened along the suture, rather strongly punctate-striate‚ the punctures stained
with piceous, The piceous coloration of the under surface varies greatly in extent; in
some specimens it is confined to the sides of the body, in others it extends over the
whole breast and prothorax.

This species agrees in general form with 0. histriom'ea, but differs in coloration3 the

antennae are more robust, and the emargination of the anal segment of the abdomen in
the female is different.

Head finely and subremotely punctured. Antennae two thirds the length of the body3
joints cylindrical, the first distinctly shorter than the second, the third somewhat longer,
the third, fourth, and fifth nearly equal in length. Thorax broader than long; sides
straight and parallel from the base to beyond the middle, thence obliquely rounded and
converging to the apex; anterior angle moderately produced, obtuse3 hinder angle
acute; upper surface impressed with large round punctureS, which are crowded on the
sides, more distant on the disc, the medial line almost impunctate. Elytra broader than
the thorax, subelongate, parallel anteriorly, slightly converging behind the middle,
obtusely rounded at the apex, obsoletely angulate-emarginate at the suture in the
female3 moderately convex, slightly flattened along the suture, rather strongly punctate-
striate, the punctures less strongly impressed behind the middle in the male.
