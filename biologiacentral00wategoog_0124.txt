108 PHYTOPHAGA.

obtusely truncate at the apex, the posterior angle produced laterally into a short
triangular plate3 each elytron with eight regular rows of punctureS, the second, fourth,
and sixth interspaces costate, the apex of the third costa extending over the surface of
the dilated posterior angle; a narrow submarginal vitta extending from base to apex
and running along the edge of the cristate humeral callus, together with a narrow
subapical band, rufo-piceous; the dilated posterior angle dark piceous; in the single
specimen before me there is a faint trace of a small subapical black spot.

Similar in form to U. elevata, but less than half the size‚ its antennae unicolorous.

26. Uroplata centromaculata.
Uroplata (Oeclei-spa) centromaculata, Chapuis, Arm. Soc. Ent. Belg. xx. p. 24 (1877) ¹.

Hah. Msxmol, Tuxtla (Sallek GUATEMALA, Duefias (Okampion).

This species, which is well although briefly described by Dr. Chapuis‚ is much
shorter and broader than U. elevata and U. buqueti3 its antennae are shorter, being

scarcely longer than the head and thorax3 the thorax is more transverse3 the elytra are
oblongquadrate and the humeral callus is more strongly cristate.

00. Humeral callus not elevate-cristato.

27. Uroplata haematopyga. (rab. 1v. fig. 18.)

Anguste subcuneiformis, dorso depressa3 subtus nitida, supra subopaca, rufa, capitis vertice nigro; antennis
rigidis, ad apicem paullo incrassatis; thorace transverse, rude punctam, plus minusve piceo tinct03
elytris ante medium parallelis, apicem versus paullo ampliatis, apice obtuse rotundatis, angulo postico
lateraliter paullo product0, obtuso ; lateribus minute, margine apicali magis distincte, serrulatis3 utrisque
octo-seriato-punctatis, interspatiis secundo, quarto sextoque, nec non sutura, costatis3 nigro-piceis, apice
maculisque parvis disooidalibus rufis.

Long. 2343 lin.

Hah. Mxxlco, Cordova (Hbqe); PANAMA, Bugaba 800 to 1500 feet (Champion).

Vertex and front plane, the latter carinate on the medial line. Antennae slightly
longer than the head and thorax, robust‚ thickened towards the apex3 joints cylindrical.
'Thorax nearly one half broader than long; sides converging from the base to the apex,
sinuate near the base and again just before the apex3 subcylindrical above, transversely
excavated on the hinder disc, coarsely and deeply foveolate-punctate 3 more or less
stained with piceous‚ in some specimens this colour co'vering almost the entire surface.
Elytra parallel from the base to beyond the middle, slightly dilated posteriorly, obtusely
rounded at the apex, the posterior angle distinctly laterally produced, obtusely rounded;
lateral margin finely, the apical border more strongly, serrulate; each elytron with
eight regular rows of punctures, the suture, together with the second, fourth, and sixth
interspaceS, costate.

The specimen fiom Bugaba is rather smaller, more darkly coloured, and the elytra
have a distinct metallic violaceous tint ; the fiont is also less distinctly carinate.
