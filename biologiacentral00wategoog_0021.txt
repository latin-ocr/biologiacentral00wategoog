AMPLIPALPA.—ALURNUS. 5

This species is very closely allied to S. attenuata, but is separated by its smaller size,
more robust and shorter antennae, and (in the male) by the less deeply concave apex of
the anal segment of the abdomen.

AMPLIPALPA.

Amplipalpa, v. Harold, Col. Heft. xiii. 1875, p. 185.
OEdiopalpa, Baly, Cat. Hispidae, p. 16.
All the species of this genus have the joints of the palpi more or less compressed and

dilated. One species only is known as yet from Central America, the rest occurring in
various localities in South America from Colombia to Brazil.

This insect, although having an extensive range, and apparently not uncommon‚
¹appears to have been but very rarely met with by Mr. Champion, only two specimens,
from the State of Panama‚ having been sent by him.

ALURNUS.
Alternus, Fabricius, Ent. Syst. ii. p. 51, no. 54.
The species of Alurnus are all large and conspicuous insects, with the exception of
A. maryv’matws, the coloration of each (within certain limits) tolerably constant; the

range of the genus is from Mexico to Southern Brazil. Mr. Champion tells me that
these insects are found upon the broad-leaved Musaceae in the virgin forest of the low

country.
