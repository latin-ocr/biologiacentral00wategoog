The northern limit for this Tropical-American genus, which contains some of the
giants of the Family‚ is probably in Costa Rica. The locality for 0. alama requires
corroboration. ’

This species was not identified by Boheman. In the Baly collection there is a
specimen labelled with this name, and marked as from Panama, agreeing fairly well
with the description, so far as it goes, except that the spots on the broad fulvous
marginal vitta of the elytra are more numerous (Westwood gives 5 or 6). The locality
‘⁶ Mexi00,” like that for Alurna cassidem †, a species of Hispidae described by West-
wood on the same page, is certainly a mistake, and it is exceedingly probable that
both insects are from Brazil. The locality of Baly’s specimen is equally doubtful.
0. alurna is evidently a very close ally of the Brazilian 0. imperialis, Boh.

MESOMPHALIA.

Mesomphalia, Hope, Ann. Nat. Hist. iii. p. 94, t. 4. fig. 1 (1840) 3 Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. i.

About 250 species of this genus have been described, all American, ranging from
Mexico to the Argentine Republic‚ but especially numerous in the warmer parts of
the southern continent. When larger series of some of the southern forms are
collected, it is certain that many of them will have to be sunk as varieties. Of the
