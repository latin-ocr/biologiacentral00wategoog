smooth and shining, very finely and remotely punctured. Elytra broader than the
thorax, obtusely rounded at the apex; disc smooth and shining, very finely punctate-
striate.

Very similar in form to 0. molismi, somewhat smaller, the third joint of the
antennae in the male cylindrical.

The specimens from Guatemala and Mexico differ from the Colombian ones in
having the pygidium in the female entire or only very faintly sinuate on one or the
other side3 in the male, on the contrary, the same segment is sometimes obsoletely
sinuate in the medial line 3 the transverse impression at the base of the thorax is also
occasionally absent, and the antennae are sometimes entirely black3 in all other respects
they agree with the typical form.

10. GephaJoIeia puncticollis.

Sat elongata, fulva, nitida3 antennis nigris3 thorace transverso, lateribus a basi fere ad apicem rectis, parallelis3
disco sat fortiter punctato; elytris subelongatis, fere parallelis, apice obtuse rotundatis, regulariter
punctato-striatis, punctis piceo tinctis.

Hah. Nmfflem, Chontales (Belt); Cosam R10A‚ Cache (Roqers) ; ΡΑΝΔΜΑ, Volcan

de Chiriqui 2500 to 4000 feet, Bugaba (Champion).

Antennae filiform, rather more than half the length of the body, black3 joints
cylindrical, the basal one slightly thickened, very slightly compressed, longer than the
second, the latter oblong. Vertex and front distinctly punctured. Thorax one third
broader than long; sides straight and parallel from the base nearly to the apex, then
rounded and converging to the anterior angle, the latter obtuse3 hinder angle slightly
produced, very acute ; disc transversely convex‚ impressed (but not very closely) with
large round punctures. Elytra rather broader than the thorax, parallel, very slightly
dilated below the middle, convex‚ flattened along the suture, rather strongly and

. regularly punctate-striate, the punctures more or less stained with piceous.

Very closely allied to 0. proxima, and possibly only a local form of that species,
separated by the narrow thorax and by the rather more parallel form.

11. cephaloleia congener.

Sat elongata, sordide rufo-fulva, nitida3 antennis cylindriois, nigrim thorace transverso, lateribus a basi ad
ultra medium rectis, leviter divergentibus, hinc ad apicem rotundato-angustatis3 disco remote punctat03
elytris anguste oblongo-ovatis, regulariter punctato-stfiatis.
