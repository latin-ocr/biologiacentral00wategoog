HIMATIDIUM (p. 126).

5. Himatidium sanguineum. (Tab. x111. figg. 22; 22 a, antenna.)

Ovate‚ slightly convent, shining, diluto sanguineous‚ the expanded margins of the prothorax‚ and of the elytra
towards the apex, flavous; the antennoe testaceou3‚ with the apical three joints‚ the tip of the eleventh
excepte& black3 the legs testaceous; the under surface msc-testaceous. Head almost smooth.
Antennae nearly three times as long as the prothorax‚ rigid‚ filiform‚ joints 1 and 2 moderatoly
long, equal‚ 3 nearly one half longer than 2 or 4, 4-10 gradually decreasing in length, 11 much longer
than 10, acuminate. Prothorax twice as broad as long, deeply emarginate in front, strongly bisinuate
behind3 the sides converging almost from the base, moderately expanded‚ concavo, smooth, and sub·
hyalino, the exterior edge not thickened; the hind angles distinct, the anterior angles obtuse ; the disc
sparsely punctured at the sides and along the base, for the rest smooth. Scutellum triangular, smooth.
Elytra broad oval, much wider than the prothorax‚ trisinuate at the base, almost separately rounded at
the apex, and with rather obtuse humeri ; the disc strongly transversely depressed behind the prominent
humeral callus, with regular rows of deep, rather coarse puncturas, which become finer at the apex, the
interstices smooth and almost flat3 the margins moderately expanded throughout, smooth and concave,
subhyaline posterior] y.

Length 5, breadth 3ss minim.

Hah. COSTA Rmn, Volcan de Irazu (Roqers).

One specimen. This species is a close ally of the Colombian H. fulvum, Boh. (the
type of which is before me); but differs from it in its more convex shape, the elytra
more shining and more coarsely punctured‚ with the margins more broadly expanded
at the apa, the prothorax less expanded at the sides and narrowing almost from
the base. The antennae are similarly formed in the two specieS, but they are very
differently coloured, II. fulvum having the joints 1, 2, and 11 rufo-testaceous and
3-10 black.

Both species differ from the typical members of the genus in having the prothorax
very much narrower than the elytra; they have much the facies of certain Hispidae.
