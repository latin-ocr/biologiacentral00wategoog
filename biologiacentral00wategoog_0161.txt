Hah. N1cARAGUA, Chontales (sanson).

One specimen. Closely allied to M. caeruleonotata and M. isthmica‚ but differently

coloured and with the prothorax less deeply emarginate in front. The type is con·-
tained in the collection of Mr. Ο. Ε. J anson.

15. Mesomphalia quadrivittata. (Tab. vl. fig. 16, «ς .)

Rotundate (ὅ), more ovate, and a little less obtuse behind ( ῼ ), convex, slightly shining3 the head and
prothorax testaceous or rufo-testaocous‚ the latter with the hasal edge very narrowly black3 the scutellum
black 3 the elytra flavous or flavo-testaceouS, with two broad vittae on the disc, extending from the base
nearly to the apex and becoming coalescent behind, and the suture and lateral margins rather broadly,
black; the antennae black‚ with the four basal joints more or less testaceous; the femora and tibiae
testaceous‚ sometimes in great part piceous‚ the tarsi black; the under surface (the margins of the
epipleurae excepted) testaceous‚ the breast and abdomen sometimes largely piceous. Head deeply grooved
in the middle; antennae extending to a little beyond the base of the prothorax‚ the four hasal joints
shining and almost smooth, the others densely punctured and opaque. Prothorax twice as broad as long,
broadly and rather deeply arcuato—emarginate in front, the sides rapidly, arcuately eonverging from the
base, obliquely so in front, the base strongly sinuate on either side, the hind angles rather obtuse, the
median lobe broad and obtuse, moderately produced; the disc somewhat conver, a h'ttle flattened in frent,
with a fine, interrupted median groove; the margins moderately concave; the entire surface sparsely‚
finely'punctured, the punctures coarser at the sideS. Scutellum moderately large, smooth. Elytra (6 )
one-half broader than , and about three and a half times as long as, tho prothorax, conjointly rounded at
the apex, slightly longer, and with the sutural angles a little sharper in the female, rounded at the sides
in both sexes, the base strongly bisinuate, the humeri rounded, rather prominent in front3 the disc
regularly rounded: the margins broadly expanded (d )‚ moderately expanded and somewhat deflexed
(ῼ )‚ the exterior limb narrowly reflexed‚ strongly so at the base; the entire suriace thickly, rather
coarsely punctate. Beneath glabrous, almost smooth., the epipleurae punctured as above. Claws obtusely

appendiculate.

Hah. ΝΙΟΑΒΑθυΑ, Βίυ San J uan (Janson); CosrA Rch (Gabb).

Three specimen8‚ all contained in Mr. Ο. Ε. J anson’s collection. This species has
much the facies of a Poecilaspis, resembling M. poecz'laspoide3, Baly. in shape‚ but it
differs from that genus in its more deeply emarginate prothorax, the antennae with the
four basa] joints only smooth‚ &c.; the non-produced hind angles of the prothorax
separate it from Chelymmplza. M. quadrivittata is not closely allied to any species
known to me. 'l'he Costa Rican specimen is figured.
