180 PHYTOPHAGA.

This insect has not hitherto been recorded from north of Brazil. In life, the
numerous raised callosities on the elytra are of a brilliant metallic golden or golden-

green, in contrast to the blackish or castaneous colour of the dorsum. We have
received four specimens from within our limits.

3. Charidotis flavomarginata. (Ταῦ. ΙΧ. fig. 21.)

Broadly elliptic, very convex, shining, sanguineous3 the prothorax and elytra bordered with piceous along
the outer part of the disc, their expanded margins dilute flavous and subhyaliue 3 the antennae, legs, and
under surface (the inner half of the epipleura excepted) testaceous. Antennae short, not extending beyond
the base of the prothorax‚ joint 3 very short, much shorter than, and not nearly so stout as, 2, 4 very
little longer than 3, 5 and 6 snbequal, longer than 4, 7-11 stout, 8-10 88 broad as long, 11 twice as
long 88 10, acuminato. Prothorax broadly dilated at the sides and in front3 che disc deeply, obliquely
grooved at the base on either side of the very broadly truncated median lobe, and with some scattered
distinct punctures at the sides behind. Scutellum very large, smooth. Elytra about two 81111 0118 third
times as long 88, 81111 at the sides forming a continuone outline with, the prothorax‚ deeply sinuate-
emarginate at the base, and with prominent subangular humeri; the disc very convex, bifoveate at the
base, hollowed behind the prominent humeral callus, and rather abruptly declivous behind and at the
sides, with rows of moderately coarse, not very closely placed punctures (which become finer towards the
suture) extending to the apex, the interstices smooth and almost flat3 the margins only moderately

expanded, becoming very narrow at the apex, smooth, and reticulate, separated from the disc by a row of
very deep foveae.

Length 43-43, breadth 33 mfflim.
Hah. GUATEMALA‚ Ghacoj and La Tinta in Vera Paz (Champion).

Three examples, all from the lower part of the Polochic Valley. This small species
is perhaps nearest allied to C. erythrostiqma. It has the fourth joint of the antennae
very little longer than the third, it being shorter than in most of the allied forma

4. Char-idetis erythrostigma. (Tab. IX. fig. 23.)

Broadly elliptic, very convex, shining‚ blaek, the expanded margins of the prothorax and elytra dilute flavous
and hyaline3 the elytra with 8 common transverse yellowish-red patch before the middle—narrowing
outwardly 81111 reaching to the fisth interstiee‚ and extending along the suture to the base3 the legs and
antennae flavo-testaceous3 the underside black, the ventrsl segments flavo-testaceous. Antennae short,
not extending beyond the base of the prothorax‚ joint 3 very short, much shorter than, and not nearly so
stout as, 2, 4-6 subequal, each much longer than 3, 7-11 stout, 8-10 as broad 88 long, 11 twice 88 long
as 10, acuminato. Prothorax broadly dilated and reticulate at the sides and in front; the disc deeply
obliquely grooved at the base on either side of the very broadly truncaoed median lobe and with some
seattered distinct punctures at the sides behind. Scutellum very large, almost smooth. Elytra about two
and a half times the length of, and at the sides forming a continuous outline with, the prothorax‚ deeply
sinuate-emarginate at the base, and with prominent subaugular humeri: the disc very eonvex, bifoveate
at the base, hollowed behind the prominent humeral callus, and somewhat abruptly declivous towards
the apex and at the sides, with rows of closely placed, deep, rather coarse punctures extending to the apex ,
the interstices smooth ; the margins only moderately expanded, becoming very narrow at the apex, smooth,

81111 reticulate, separaoed from the disc by a row of very deep foveae.
Length 5, breadth 4 miuim.

Hah. ΜΕΧιοο, Cerro de Plumas (Hbqe).

One example only of this very distinct species has been received. It is allied to the
Brazilian G. rubrom‘ncta and Ο. οἰνοωηεωῆφτα, Βο11., from both of which it differs in
the common transverse yellowish-red patch on the elytra, and in having the punctures
