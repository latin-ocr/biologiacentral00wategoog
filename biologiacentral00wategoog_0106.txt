above generic form, the characters of which} are clearly given by Guerin in the specific ·
description of Brachycoryna pumila, the species on which it was founded by that author.
Von Harold (Mun. Catal.) subsequently placed the insects in Octotoma, a genus with
which, the structure of the antennae excepted‚ it has no affinity.

Since the earlier part of this work was published, I have, through the kindness of
Dr. Horn, received a specimen of Stenopodius flaviam of that author. It belongs to
the present section of the family, and stands close to Brachycoryna. It agrees with
that genus in possessing very short antennae, but differs in the produced anterior margin
of the thorax, and in the greater number of punctate-striae on its elytra. S. flavidws
is a native of California, and will probably, sooner or later, be found in Central
America.

Guerin, in bis description of the species, gives the elytra as unicolorous. In all the
specimens that I have seen they are more or less spotted with piceous or black.

Hah. PANAMA, Tole (Ohampion).

Vertex granulose, impressed on the medial line with a deep longitudinal fovea.
Antennae rather shorter than the head and thorax3 joints cylindrical, gradually
increasing in thickness from the third to the sixth; this last nearly as long as the
preceding two united, and together with the five upper jointS, which are closely united,
forming an oblong acute club. Thorax scarcely longer than broad; sides slightly
rounded, parallel at the base, converging towards the apex3 upper surface subcylin-
drical, granulose, coarsely and closely punctured, the medial line with a longitudinal
groove. Elytra oblong, parallel, regularly rounded at the apex, the outer margin finely
serrulate3 above convex, each elytron with three strongly elevated costae, the inner one,
which is interrupted below the basilar space, terminating some distance before reaching
the apical margin, its apex curving abruptly outwards‚ and the outer two, which are
shorter than the preceding one, interrupted for the greater part of their course, their
apices being confluent and abruptly elevated; spaces between the costae each with a
double row of large deep punctures; on the inner costa, near its middle, is a small

fulvous spot.
