Hah. Mnxlco (coll. Chevrolat 1).

We have not received a specimen of this insect; but there is an example of it,

doubtless the type, marked ‘⁶ ex Chevrolat,'’ in the Hamlet Clark collection of Cassididae,
now in the National Museum. It is probably a variety of C. juvenca. The elytra are
sanguineouS, with the suture, the exterior margin, and a median fascia black.

15. Chelymorpha mexicana. (Tab. VII. fig. 9, 9 .)

Subovate ( (ς), oblong ovate (9), moderately convex, glabrous‚ shining3 rufo-testaceous or testaceous‚ the
head, two small dots on the disc of the prothorax (often obsolete)‚ and the scutellum, black3 the elytra
each with six or seven spots, and sometimes a narrow streak below the shoulder‚ and a common sub-
quadrate or oval mark on the suture some little distance below the base, blank, the spots placed thus-—
two a little below the base (one on the humeral callus, the other lower down and midway between it and
the sutural mark), three in a transverse row about the middle (the inner one transverse, near the sature,
the outer one on the margin and in front of the other two), one, usually small, on the disc midway
between the inner one of these and the apex, and sometimes one close to the margin behind this3 the
antennae, legs, and under surface black, the antennae with joints 1-5 more or less rufo-testaceous beneath.
Head coarsely, rugosely punctured and sharply canaliculate between the eyes, the groove limited on
either side by a smooth cariniform elevation, the lower part with coarse separate punctures; antennae
rather stout, scarcely reaching to the base of the prothorax, the five basa] joints shining and almost
smooth. Prothorax convex‚ twice as broad as long, broadly arcuata-emarginate in front, the sides rounded
almost from the base (more strongly so in the male) and rapidly converging from the middle forwards,
the base deeply emarginate on either side eivtternally= the median lohe broad and obtuse, the hind angles
sharp and produced behind3 the disc with an interrupted median groove‚ sparsely, very finely punctate;
the margins moderate] y expanded‚ deflexed‚ coarsely‚ confluently punctam, the outer edge not thickened.
Scutellum transversely triangular, smooth. Elytra moderately convex, somewhat flattened on the disc
anteriorly‚ in the ὅ about three, in the 9 sully three and a half, times as long as the prothorax‚ at the
base not wider than it, slightly dilated at the middle, the sides obliquely converging thence to the base
in the ὁ· , gradually converging in the 9 , the humeri obtuse and embraced by the hind angles of the
prothorax, the apices conjointly rounded ; the margins moderatcly expanded and strongly deflexed3 the
entire surface closely, finely punctate, the punctures on the margins closer and finer than those on the

disc. Beneath glabrous‚ smooth, the metapleuroe coarsely rugose; prosternam shallowly sulcate poste-
riorly. Claws appendiculate.

Length, (ς 9 ‚ 9-113, breadth 6-73 minim.
Hah. Mmco, Guanajuato (Salle), San J uan del Rio (Hbqe).

Numerous exampleS. Closely allied to 0. ὂίαηηαῖανῐε, but evidently distinct from

that variable insect. The elytral spots are small and show no tendency to coalesce,
the external one of the posterior two being often obsolete.
