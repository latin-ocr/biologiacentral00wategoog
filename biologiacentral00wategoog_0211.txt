Var. a. The elytra with almost the entire disc black, obscure castaneous, or castanaeus, with a broad similarly
coloured ramus extending across the margins to the humeri aud a narrow stripe along the suture to the
apex, the light markings sometimes faintly indicated3 the protborax with a broad black or castanaeus

Var. β. Τὴο elytra with an oblique sinuous castaneous stripe on the outer part of the disc, usually bordered
with piceous below the humeral callus, extending broadly across the margins to the humeri, and with
or without irregular rami extending inwards‚ the suture also narrowly bordered with castaneous or rufo-
testaceous at the apex ; the markings on the prothorax faint or obsolete. (Fig. 21.)

This very variable and widely distributed species was incorrectly identified by Boheman
with Ο. quttata (Oliv.) (=0ruoiata‚ Fabr., nec Linn.)‚ as may be at once seen by a com-
parison of his description with Olivier’s figures (Eut. vi. no. 97, t. 1. figg. 13 a, b),
C. quitata having the elytral margins ‚subhyaline throughout. Olivier in his second
description of 0. quttata (Ent. vi. no, 97, p. 955), which is based upon more than one
example, quotes 0. cruciata, Fabr. (nec Linn.)‚ as a synonym‚ and states that the insect
is from Tropical America, and is contained in the Banksian cabinet. The specimens
he mentions are still extant: one, from which 'his figures were no doubt taken, is the
eastern 0. samquttata (Boisd.), Boh.‚ the other the Mexican 0. extensa, Βοὴ.; the name
guttam, Oliv„ therefore, will have to be applied to Ο. semuncta, Boisd. There ean be
no doubt that the description and figure of 0. siqnffera‚ Herbst‚ apply to our insect‚
and I accordingly adopt that name for it. 0. trabeata (of which I have seen a Mexican
specimen from Chevrolat in the British Museum) and Ο. lucidum, Boh.‚ have already
been sunk as varieties of 0. siqmfi’ra, and I have no hesitation in adding C. hamulum,
