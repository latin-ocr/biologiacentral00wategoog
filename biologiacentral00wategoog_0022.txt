the sides and at the base, remote on the medial disc. Elytra oblong, acutely rounded
at the apeX, conveX, distinctly punctured, fiavous; each with the apical fourth and
three large patches, placed two obliquely below the base, one on the humeral callus,
θ the other on the inner disc, and a third transverse, obliquely placed near the middle,
black. Extreme apex of abdomen fulvous.

This insect differs from A. ornatus in the less coarsely punctured and entirely black
thorax3 in all other respects the two species closely agree. Its coloration is constant,
so that I have considered it as distinct from the preceding insect.

Mr. Champion found this species upon the leaves of Musaceae in the virgin forest of
the low country.

The variety with black elytra from Ecuador, described by Mr. C. Ο. Waterhouse

[Proc. Zool. Soc. 1881, p. 265], is much narrower than the typical form, and probably
belongs to another specieS.

XANTHISPA.
Xantkispa, Baly, Cat. Hispidae, p. 31.

Alth ough the insect here described differs from the original diagnosis of Xanthispa
(l. c. p. 32) in having the second joint of the antennae short, it agrees so completely in
the formation of the parts of the mouth with the typical species [X. cimicoidest, Guerm,
from Cayenne], that I do not hesitate to place it in the same genus.
