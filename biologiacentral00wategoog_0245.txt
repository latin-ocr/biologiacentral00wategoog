OTENOCIIIRA. 229

C. sertata, Boh. (=var2'an3‚ Wag.), is an allied form occurring in Tropical South America.
We figure a typical ( ῼ ) C. vivida from Teapa; a specimen ( ὃ ) of the var. nzssqrocincta
from Chiriqui; and a brightly·coloured example ( ῼ )of the var. tabida from Chiriqui.

This insect differs from some of the varieties os 0. vivida only in its paler colour—
the black patch on the prothorax being replaced by a sanguineous edging and some
small similarly-coloured spot8‚ and the black annulus on the elytra replaced by a narrow
marginal stripe‚—and in having the eighth and ninth joiuts of the antennae infuscate.
This last-mentioned character, however, is not constant. Boheman's description was
taken from an example with the disc of the elytra dilute sanguineous: in the speci·
mens before me it is flavo-testaceous, with the punctures and margins sanguineouS.
Sent in abundance from Teapa, in company with 0. vivida aud its var. tabida.

Sent in plenty from Teapa, in company with 0. vivida, 0. punicea, and 0. hiero·
quphica. It is nearest allied to C. punicea, from which it may be distinguished by the
definite markings on the prothorax and by the antennae having only the tip of the
apical joint black. Boheman’s description appears to have been made from specimens
with the dark markings on the thorax partly obliterated3 in most of the examples
before me the prothorax has a large subtriangular black patch‚ enclosing nine flavous
spots (as in 0. cumulata), these varying in size and often becoming more or less
confluent. In the specimens from Chontales the dark markings on the prothorax
are reduced to small disconnected spotS. We figure a specimen from Atoyac.
