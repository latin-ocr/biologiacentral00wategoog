before the middle. D. distincta is probably a variety of the preceding with the
discal spot on each elytron obliterated. The Guatemalan specimen in the British
Museum determined as D. princeps by Boheman 2 belongs here; there is perhaps
some mistake about this locality, as all the Guatemalan specimens I have seen of this
genus belong to the preceding, D. bisbzplaqiata.

The type of this species ( ὁ· ) is contained in the Baly collection. D. con-speretpssnnis
is closely allied to the variable D. varieqata (Fabr.), from Cayenne. Panama specimens
are much smaller than the type, and they have the elytra more rugosely punctured.
The two transverse markings in the expanded margins of the elytra are much smaller
and narrower than in D. vaffleqata, and they are usually disconnected and distant from
the similarly coloured exterior limb3 the anterior one, as well as several of the spots
on the disc, is often entirely obsolete. The colour of the prothorax and of the
markings of the elytra varies from greenish-aeneous to black ; the prothorax often has
an oblong sanguineous spot on either side of the disc behind. The type from the
Baly collection is figured.

I have seen five specimens of this species from the Isthmus of Panama. They vary
' a good deal as regards the distribution of the aeneous colour on the elytra, the disc
being sometimes wholly suffused. The broadly expanded margins are marked with
from 6-8 irregular spots, the anterior ones being strongly transverse and larger than
the otherS‚ all distant from the similarly-coloured exterior limb. A single specimen
from Colombia in the Baly collection no doubt belongs to a variety of the same
species; it has the elytra entirely greenish-aeneouS‚ with the exception of a large
sanguineous patch on the expanded margin before the middle, this patch being marked
with three irregular transverse aeneous fasciae. Another specimen in the same
collection is intermediate between this and the var. B of Baly.
