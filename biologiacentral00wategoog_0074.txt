Vertex smooth, impunctate, impressed with a longitudinal groove; interocular
space moderately but distinctly produced, obtuse. Antennae rather longer than the
head and thorax; joints cylindrical, the five outer ones distinctly thickened. Thorax
broader than long ; sides obsoletely angulate, nearly straight and parallel from the base
to the middle, thence slightly converging to the apex, anterior angle armed with a
strong, oblique, obtuse tooth; subcylindrical, faintly excavated on either side the medial
line, strongly and coarsely punctured. Elytra oblong, very slightly dilated posteriorly;
hinder angle obtuse, very slightly produced in the male, rather less distinctly so in the
female3 apices conjointly‚ obtusely rounded in either sex3 sides and apex rather
coarsely serrulate; each elytron with eight, at its extreme base with nine, rows of
punctures, the puncturing of the rows between the first and second oostae confused
towards the apex (in some specimens there are traces on the hinder disc of an additional
row); second, fourth, and sixth interspaces, together with the suture, costate ; the
discoidal costae terminate before reaching the hinder margin of the elytron; the third
or outer costa is cristate at its termination, and is connected with the raised apex of the
second or intermediate one by a short curved ridge; a transverse raised line (sometimes
ill-defined) also connects the apices of the first and third costae.

Contrary to the opinion of American entomologists, I cannot help considering
0. rosen-3, Weber, and O. inoequalis of the same author, usually united under the former
name, to be distinct. C. roseus is separated by the pale antennae, and by the obtuse
apices and the more or less defined, hinder angle of the elytra; distinct and apparently
constant differences also exist in the elytral costae. In 0. inoequalis the apices of the
elytra are regularly rounded, the posterior angles being obsolete and the apices of all the
costae free3 the third or outer costa is not more strongly raised posteriorly, as is the
case in the present species. Both insects are equally variable in coloration.

I do not (with one exception) give any synonymy, as I have not had an opportunity ’
