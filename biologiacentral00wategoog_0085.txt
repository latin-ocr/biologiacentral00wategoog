omerus. 69

I have united the two species of Chapuis for the following reasons: the punctu-
ation of the thorax and the angularity of its sides vary greatly in different individuale,

and the fulvous vittae on the elytra also greatly vary in length, being sometimes confined
to a small basal patch.

V. Elytra each with ten reqular rows of pwncturea ,
1 . Second and eiqhth interspaoes costate, entire.

Hah. PANAMA, David, Bugaba 800 to 1500 feet, Caldera in Chiriqui 1200 feet, San
Lorenzo, Volcan de Chiriqui 2000 to 3000 feet (Ohampion).

Vertex smooth and shining; front subnitidouS, rather strongly produced between the
eyeS‚ trisulcate3 clypeus subpentangular, rugose, impressed at the apex with two large
oblique foveae. Antennae half the length of the body, filiform; joints cylindrical, the
terminal one acute3 two lower joints short, equal in length, the first of these thickened,
submoniliform, the second ovate3 third joint rather longer than the preceding two
united. Thorax transverse3 sides sinuate at the base, then nearly straight to the
middle, thence gradually convergi'ng towards the apex, anterior angle armed with a
short obtuse tooth; basal margin deeply excavated on either side in order to receive
the strongly produced basal lobes of the elytra 3 above subcylindrical in front and on
the sides, basal half of disc deeply and transversely excavated3 surface smooth, velvety‚
faintly impressed on the sides with a few large, very shallow and ill-defined foveae.
Scutellum broader than long, subquadrate. Elytra subelongate, each with the basal
margin produced into a strong lobe which fits, when at rest, into the corresponding
basal excavation of the thorax3 sides parallel, slightly constricted in the middle,
irregularly serrulate, the serratures (fine at the base) gradually increasing in size
towards the hinder angle ; apex rounded, armed with strong acute teeth 3 upper
surface convex on the sides, flattened along the suture, coarsely granulose3 each elytron
with ten rows of round nitidous punctures; the second interspace raised into a strong
smooth nitiflous costa, the basal and apical portions of the fourth and sixth, together

with the whole of the eighth, also costate *, but less strongly so than the second. Legs
slender, elongate.

¹* In some specimens the hasal portion of the fourth, in others the apex of the sixth, interspace is not
costato.
