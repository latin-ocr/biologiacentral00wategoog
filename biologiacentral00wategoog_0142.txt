126 PHYTOPHAGA.

Hah. ΡΑΝΑΜΑ, Bugaba (Champion).

Three examples‚ found in the forest-region of the “ tierra caliente ’' of Chiriqui.
These differ from the Amazonian specimen of D. cossyphoides, Gaetu, in the British
Museum‚ determined by Boheman, and from a second from the same locality in
the Baly collection, in having an additional row of impressions on the expanded
margins of the elytra, the innermost (the ninth from the suture) being also much less
coarse. D. panamensis is perhaps an extreme form of the rare D. cossyphoides, but in
any case it is advisable to name it. To avoid future confusion, the description of an
allied Sonth-American species is added below ⁴.

HIMATIDIUM.

Imatidium‚ FabriciuS, Syst. Eleuth. i. p. 345 (1801).
Himatidium, Illiger, Mag. iii. p. 131 (1804) 3 Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. i. p. 63.

A Tropical-American genus containing numerous described species, four only of
which inhabit Central America. Chapuis has noted an important character in this
genus, viz, the more or less connate first and second segments of the abdomen, this

peculiarity being common to the Hispidae3 Himatidium, in fact, forms one of the
connecting-links between the families Cassididae and Hispidae. H. limbatellum‚ Boh.‚
from Mexi00‚ was transferred by Baly to the genus Demetispa, see antea, p. 28.

⁴* Delocrania latipennis.

Obscure ferrugineus, the outer portion of the disc of the elytra darker3 the margins of the prothorax dilate
ferrugineus, becoming fiavons in front3 the margins of the elytra dilute flavo-'testaceous‚ ferruginous at
the extreme base ς the antennae obscure ferrugineus. Head with a few rather coarse punctnres behind,
depressed and canaliculato in front. Prothorax densely and rather coarsely punctured on the dis03 the
margins thickly covered with irregular foveae, each formed by two confluent puncturas. Elytra
considerably wider than the prothorax, subparallel‚ separately rounded at the apex; the dise coar-sely
and closely sedate-punctam, the suture and the fifth interstice, and the third interstice at the base,
costat03 the margins concavo towards the base, with four rows of impressione—those of the innermost
row (the ninth from the sature) exceedingly coarse and deep, and somewhat distant from each other,
those of the three outer rows rather irregular, small, shallow, and closely packed, and separated from the

inner row by a distinct space in which traces of another row of small Mpressions is visible‚—the inter-
spaces feebly transversely wrinkled.—-—Length 53 minim.

Hah. Ecmnon (coll. Baly). One example.
