10 PHYTOPHAGA.

Head sparingly punctured. Basal joint of the antennae compressed, subclavate3 the
second scarcely more than half the length of the first (the remaining joints in the single
specimen before me broken off). Thorax slightly broader than long; sides straight
and parallel, incurved at the apex3 apical angles rounded, distinctly produced3 hinder
angles slightly produced, acute; disc smooth and shining, sparingly impressed on either
side with large, round punctures. Scutellum trigonate, slightly longer than broad.
Elytra parallel, obtusely truncate at the apeX, flattened along the suture, finely
punctam-striate, the striae on the inner side obsoletely sulcate.

Hah. PANAMA, Volcan de Chiriqui 2500 to 6000 feet (Ohampion).

Head smooth and shining, vertex and frent impressed with a longitudinal groove.
Antennae filiform, less than half the body in length, the two lower joints fulvous, more
or less stained with piceouS, the rest black. Thorax subquadrate, scarcely broader than
long; sides nearly straight and parallel; the anterior angles not produced, obtuse; disc
smooth and shining, impunctate3 a large pentagonal discoidal patch attached by its
base to the apical margin, its apex extending backwards nearly to the base, black.
Scutellum longer than broad. Elytra broader than the thorax3 sides parallel, very
slightly dilated near the apex, the latter obtusely rounded; upper surface moderately
convex, slightly flattened anteriorly along the suture, regularly and rather strongly
punctate-striate, the striae faintly sulcate.

Hah. PANAMA, Volcan de Chiriqui 2500 to 4000 feet, Bugaba (Chamiooz).

Head nitidouS, very finely and sparingly punctured; face between the antennae with
a strongly raised longitudinal ridge. Antennae less than half the length of the body,
joints from the second to the apical one cylindrical in the female, the basal one
thickened, obliquely compressed at the base; four lower joints in the male compressed
and dilated, the basal one thickened and subclavate, the following three joints trigonate;
the second short, broader than long; the third and fourth less dilated, each longer than
