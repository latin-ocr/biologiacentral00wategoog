28 PHYTOPHAGA.

broad as long; sides straight and parallel from the base nearly to the middle, thence
rounded and converging to the apex; upper surface slightly convex on the disc, reflexed
on the sides, finely but not closely punctured; on the sides of the disc and along the
basal margin are a number of large round foveolate punctures. Elytra subquadrate-

ovate; sides rather broadly dilated, reflexed3 regularly and distinctly punctate-striate‚
the striae on the outer disc subsulcate.

Long. 3 lin.

Hah. GUATEMALA¹ (Salle3 type, Boheman).

Antennae slender‚ filiform‚ more than half the length of the body; joints cylindrical,
the second distinctly longer than the basal one, the third longer than the preceding
two united. Thorax twice as broad as long; sides straight and slightly diverging
from the base nearly to the middle, thence broadly rounded and converging to the
apeX, posterior angle acute; upper surface broadly reflexed on the sides, smooth
and impunctate on the anterior disc, sparingly impressed with deep punctures at the
base and towards the lateral margin. Elytra broader than the thoraX, subquadrate-
ovate; distinctly punctate·striate‚ the strias near the outer limb sulcate; interspaces
distinctly but finely punctured, faintly rugulose on the anterior disc; outer limb
reflexed, smooth, impunctate.

Very closely allied to D. cimbam, differing in the slightly diverging and more broadly
rounded sides of the thorax, the elytra being also more depressed and rather more
strongly punctured, and the interspaces between the striae being also finely but distinctly
punctured, The coloration of the under surface of the body is also different.

The two specimens (one of either sex) from which Boheman drew up his description

are now before me; they are fairly similar to each other. The species figured under the
name of Demetispa limbatella (Tab. II. fig. 5) is to be referred to D. cimbam.

PROSOPODONTA.
Prosopodonta, Baly, Cat. Hispidoe, p. 68, t. l. f. 15.

The species up to the present time described as belonging to this genus are few in
number; they inhabit Central America and Colombia.
