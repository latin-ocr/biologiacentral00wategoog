medium triseriatis3 vitta brevi suturali baseos picea.

Long. 23 lin.

Hah. Mssxmo, Cordova (Hc‘iqe).

Head very strongly produced between the eyes, truncate anteriorly. Antennae not
longer than the head and thorax, robust, slightly thickened towards the apex; joints
cylindrical, first very short, moniliform, second to the fourth nearly equal, each rather
longer than the basal one, the sixth to the ninth short, broader than long, the tenth or
apical joint ovate, subacute. Thorax transverse; sides converging from the base to·
the apex, bisinuate3 diso transversely convex, flattened behind, coarsely and closely
rugose-punctate. Scutellum quadrate. Elytra broader than the thorax; sides sub·
parallel, apex obtusely rounded; outer margin distinctly and rather coarsely serrulate,
the apical serratures finer than the lateral ones; each elytron before the middle with
nine, at the extreme base and on the hinder disc with ten, rows of deep punctures ; the·
second, fourth, and eighth interspaces costate, the punctures between the middle and
outer costae triseriate on the anterior and quadriseriate on the hinder disc; the sixth
interspace elevated at the base and apex, the suture also thickened.

*¹* Antennoe ll-jointed.

GHALEPUS.

Chalepue, Thunberg, Gotting. Gelehrt. Anzeig. 1805, p. 282.
Odontota, Chapuis, Gen. des Coleopt. xi. p. 318; Horn, Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc. 1883, p. 294.

Sixty-four species of this genus are contained in the present work; of this number no
less than fifty-eight are characterized for the first time. Chalepus is probably the most
numerous in species of any genus of the family, although up to recently a very
large majority of them have remained undescribed in collections. Forty-three species
are enumerated in Von Harold's Gatalogue. In 1877 the late Dr. Chapuis (cf.
Trans. Ent. Soc. de Belg. xx. pp. 5 et seq.) gave brief ⁸diagnoses of upwards of sixty
additional ones; unfortunately, in many cases, his descriptions are so brief that it is

very difficult to work out the species; he hae, however, divided the genus into sections,
which, with some alterations, I have followed here ¹⁵.

³ Dr. Chapuis has founded his sectional divisione on the number of rows of puncturas and of the eostoe on
the elytra. Many of the speeies possess a short additional row of puncturas placed at the base next the suture,
the presence or absence of which 1 have found of great use in subdividing the genus. A very great number of
speeies have the interstioes between the puncturas mere or less thickened, forming a fine irregular network
between the eostoe. I have but rarely mentioned this character in my specific descriptions.
