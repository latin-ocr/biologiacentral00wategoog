142 PHYTOPHAGA.

1 have seen altogether sixteen specimens of this species. The very large, transverse,

more or less emarginate, flavous patch on each elytron is sometimes partly, or entirely
(as in one specimen from Costa Rica), divided in the middle3 it is sometimes marked

with one or more small aeneous spots (there are three in the type), but these disappear
altogether in some examples. The anterior margin of the prothorax is narrowly
'fulvous on either side, a character separating M. salvini from many of the allied forms.

We figure the type of the male from Panama, and a variety of the female from
Costa Rica.

I have seen five specimens of the typical form of this species, all from Mexico—two
males in the Salle collection, a female in the Baly collection, and a pair in the
British Museum. The description of Boheman 1 was taken from the male sex only ;
the female is ovate, and much more elongate, with less expanded elytral margins, the
male being rotundate, with the margins of the elytra broadly expanded‚ and abruptly
and obliquely converging at the base. The following seem to be, nothing more than

varieties of the same specieS, though they all have the elytra much more finely
punctured:—

α. <3⁸ . The elytra more finely punctured than in the type ; similarly marked, i. e. with a very large irregular
sanguineous patch on the disc, extending on to the broadly expanded margins before and behind the
middle, and enclosing five aeneous spots on the dise, placed longitudinally 3, 2, the anterior one of the
inner row oblique and larger than the others: the suture aeneous throughout.

Hab. Cos'rA RicA (Van Pactam). One specimen.

β. 9 . The elytra punctured as in a ; the markings still larger, occupying the greater part of the surface, leaving
only the sutura, a common x-shaped mark before the middle, two small obliquely·placed spots on the disc
beyond the middle, three lateral patches‚ and the exterior limb, aeueous. (Fig. 10.)

Hah. PANAMA, Bugaba (Olcampion). One specimen.

γ. 9 . The elytra punctured as in α ; each with two rufous spots placed transversely before the middle—the
inner one on the middle of the disc, subtriangular or oblique, and in some specimens extending angularly
forwards, the outer one rounded externally, partly on the expanded margin,—and a similarly-coloured

slightly oblique spot on the outer part of the disc towards the apex, and sometimes with a small rufous
streak midway between the two discal spots. (Fig. 11.)

Hah. NchRAGUA, Chontales (Janson) ; Pramus, Bugaba, Volcan de Chiriqui (Cham-
pion). Five specimens.

The var. γ looks perfectly distinct, at first sight, but the difference is more apparent
than real. The red markings, as in M. punicea and M. trz'sciqma, are accompanied by
