CHALEPUS (pp. 48, 120).

3 (A). Ghalepus parallelus. (Tab. X111. fig. 23.)

Elongate‚ narrow, parallel, subopaque ; above rufo-fulvous, the 0508, the margins of the prothorax very narrowly‚
the scutellum, and the sutnre from about the basal third to the middle, black3 the antennae and legs
black, the anterior femora and tibiae partly fulvous; beneath black, the head and prothorax iu great
part, and the abdomen entirely, rufo-fulvous. Head opaque, sparsely finely punctate3 the front mode-
rately produced, sharply carinate anteriorly, the interocular space deeply triangularly depressed and
almost smooth. Antennae short, very little longer than the head and prothorax united, stout, slightly
thickened towards the apex 3 the joints cylindrical‚ 3 very little longer than 2, 4-10 transverse, 11 longer
than 10, abruptly acuminate at the tip. Prothorax transverse, very convex, slightly narrowed anterimly,
with prominent and acute front angles, the sides almost straight behind; the surface closely covered with
very coarse, deep, foveolate punctures, separated by fine raised reticulations, distinctly canaliculate down
the middle, and broadly transversely depressed before the base. Elytra very elongate, parallel ; the
lateral and apical margins finely serrulate ; the apices separately rounded; each elytron with eight regular
rows of very coarse deep punctures‚ the eighth obsolete for a short distance before the middle3 the second,

fourth, and sixth interspaces strongly costate throughout, the basal margin also strongly raised. Legs
short and stout.

Hah. MEXICO, Atoyac in Vera Cruz (H. Η. Smitlz).

One specimen. This species may be readily known by its elongate, parallel shape
and very short antennae, the elytra with only eight rows of very coarse punctures, their
apices separately rounded and very finely serrulate, the second, fourth, and sixth inter·
spaces strongly costate throughout. The penultimate joints of the antennae are closely
articulated and transverse. 0. parallelus closely resembles Uroplata limbata, Baly,
but in that insect the apical five joints of the antennae are consolidated into a single
plece.

3 (B). chalepus atrocaeruleus.

Moderately elongate, subparallel, slightly shining3 bluish-black‚ the prothorax with an oblong fulvous spot
on either side. Head opaque, the front moderately produced, carinate anteriorly, the interocular space
irregularly punctured and longitudinally trisulcate, the lateral grooves deep. Antennae nearly half the
length of the body, stout, thickening outwardly; the joints cylindrical, 3 nearly twice as long as 2,
4, 5, and 7 as long as broad, 6 transverse, 8-11 almost consolidated into a single piece. Prothorax
strongly transverse, transversely depressed behind, the sides gradually converging from the base, the
anterior angles moderately prominent; the surface closely covered with very come, deep, foveolate punc-
tures which are here and there coalescent. Elytra moderately long, subparallel, slightly wider at the
apex than at the base; the apices rounded‚ feebly conjointly emarginate at the sutural angle; the lateral
margin finely serrulate‚ the apical margin finely denticulate3 each elytron with eight regular rows of
deep punctures3 the second and fourth interspaces‚ together with the suture, strongly costato, the sixth
interspace also feebly costate. Legs moderately long.
