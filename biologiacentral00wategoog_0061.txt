Long.32}1in.
Hah. NICARAGUA, Chontales (Belt).

Antennae slender, filiform, more than half the. length of the body, two lower joints

subovate, equal, the third nearly as long as the preceding two united. Thorax not
broader than long, subconic; sides straight and parallel from the base to the middle,

thence obliquely converging and sinuate to the apex, the anterior angle produced ante·
‘riorly into a strong subacute tooth ; upper surface subcylindrical, transversely grooved at

the base, closely foveolate-punctate. Elytra parallel, slightly dilated posteriorly; apical

margin obtusely rounded‚ entire, the posterior angle armed with a strong flattened acute ·
tooth, the apex of which looks directly backwards3 upper surface with ten, at the

extreme base with eleven‚ regular rows of punctures3 fourth interspace from the suture -
moderately costate3 humeral callus laterally produced, and armed with a very long
acute black spine, the apex of which extends directly outwards.

The long humeral spine renders this species one of the most remarkable of the whole
genus. Unfortunately both the specimens before me are very imperfect.

Section ΙΙ. Basal seyment of the liqula arisinq from the dorsal sufface of the mentum.

Section 1. Antemnae 10-1137‘0inted, the five ‘appar joints distinctly separable from
each other.

ἢ· Interocwlar space not produced anterior-ly ; antewnoe Iltiointed.

The above genus, established by myself for the reception of a small group of species
from Northern and Central America, has been united by Von Harold, in his Catalogue,

with Chalepvw3 it is, however, distinctly separated by the non-prominent interocular
space, and, as pointed out by Dr. Chapuis, by the curved intermediate tibiae.
