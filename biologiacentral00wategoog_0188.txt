172 PHYTOPHAGA.

Hah. Mmco 1·3 (ex coll. Βίτωνι), Tampico in Tamaulipas (Richardson), Cordova
(Hbqe), Acapuleo (J. J. Walker), Tehuantepec (Salle).

Sent in numbers by Hoge from Cordova. This species is very like P. caudata3 but
it has the elytra more coarsely punctured, more obtuse at the apex in the male, the
sides forming almost a continuous outline with the prothoraX, the hind angles of the
latter not so obtuse. One of Boheman’s types ( ῼ ), kindly lent by the Berlin Museum‚

is figured.

21. Physonota limoniata. (Τὼ. ΙΧ. fig. 5.)
Physonota limoniam, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv. p. 247 ¹.

Hah. Maxlco, Ventanas in Durango (Ηόρθ), Omilteme in Guerrero (H. H. Smitlz),
Mochitlan in Guerrero (Baron), J uquila (Salle 1).

A typieal example from the Salle collection is figured. P. limoniam is exoeedingly
like P. euoalypta, and only differs from it in having the prothorax marked with a short
median streak and two small spots near the base, the latter sometimes with one or two
additional marks behind them.

22. Physonota. humilis. (Ταῦ. lx. fig. 4.)
Physonota humilis, Boh. Cat. col. Ins. Brit. Mus. ix. p. 102 ¹ 3 Monogr. Cassid. iv, p. 251 ².

Hah. Maxlco 1 2, GuanajuatO, Peras, J uquila (δἀῑίἑ).

Specimens from Peras and J uquila‚ both in the State of Oaxaca, agree precisely with
the type, which is here figured; those from Guanajuato are more or less immature.
The short median streak on the diso of the prothorax behind is obliterated in four out
of the eight specimens before me.

23. Physonota. ovipennis. (Tab. IX. fig. 6, s .)

Ovate (d) or oblong ovate ( ῼ ), rather eonvex, shining3 dilute flavo-testaceous, the margins hyaline, the eyes
and mouth blaek, the prothorax usually with a short fine blaekish median streak before the base; the
antennoe black, joints 2-5 testaceous beneath3 beneath blaok, the prosternam, and sometimes the sides,
narrowly‚ testaceous‚ the elytra with the base internally and the suture at the apex blaek; the legs
testaceous. Antennae extending to a little beyond the base of the prothorax3 the third joint elongate,
mueh longer than the fourth. Prothorax about twice as broad as long, feebly bisinuate at the base, with
the median lobe truncate or slightly emarginate, the sides very abruptly and obliquely eonverging
anteriorly, strongly rounded behind, the apex rounded3 the margins broadly expanded, concavo, and
reticulate3 the surfaee smooth. Elytra subeordate (d) or ovate (ῼ ), considerably wider than the
prothorax in both sexes, broader and shorter in the male than in the female, rounded at the sides and
rapidly narrowing from a little below the base, the apices distinetly produced3 the humeri broadly
rounded in the male, obtuse in the female; the margins deflexed and reticulate, broadly expanded
anteriorly, rather narrowly posteriorly3 the diso with widely seattered, very fine, subserially arranged
puncturas, the margins sparsely‚ irregularly punctate. Beneath smooth, the ventral segmenta with
seattered fine punctures.

Length 9-113, breadth 63-'7 millim.

Hah. Maxtco, Chilpancingo and Omilteme in Guerrero (H. H. small), Mochitlan in
Guerrero (Baro‘n).
