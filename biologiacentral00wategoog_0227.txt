A very abundant Tropical-American species, ranging from Northern Mexico to Brazil.
With long series of specimens from the same localitie8‚ the colour of the underside
proves (as in C. bzfossulata) to be of no value as a specific character. In typical
0. tri-siquam, of which we have received many specimens from Yucatan, the underside
is entirely testaceous; in C. bis-tm‘punctata it is in great part black3 in 0. bi-impressa
(described as having the underside flavescent) it is also in great part black in the
majority of the large number of examples before me, both forms having occurred
together at J alapa and elsewhere. The three elytral spotS‚ when present, are larger
and more distinct than in Ο. bzfossulata or 0. bicolor ; but they are sometimes obsolete
or small, or the posterior one only (0. bi-impressa) may be obliterated. 0. tri-siquam
also varies greatlyin size, the maleo, as usual, being shorter and more rotundate than
the females. C. bis-tripunctata, Herbst, from Maryland, is doubtfully quoted as a·
synonym by Boheman 3 it is perhaps a variety of 0. bicolor, Fabr. The Mexican
specimens in the British Museum which were referred by Boheman to G. limpida ¹*
, (a Brazilian insect) probably belong here; they appear to be small pallid males
of the var. bi-impressa. The Brazilian 0. seoepunctatm Fabr., is a very close ally of
0. tvi-siquam.
