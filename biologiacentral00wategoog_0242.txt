226 PHYTOPHAGA.

0. infantula, but may be known from it by the flavous slightly raised reticulations on
the disc of the elytra. In pallid examples the dark parts of the prothorax and elytra
are brownish·testaceous or castaneous.

8. ctenochira dissimilis. (Tab. ΧΠ. fig. 25.)

Hah. anco 1-3, Teapa (Pilato, in coll. Baly).

There is a single specimen of this species in the Baly collection, agreeing perfectly
with the type. 0. dissimilis is closely allied to 0. palmata (with the antennae coloured
as in the var. bilobata); but differs from it inthe much more coarsely punctured elytra,
the. disc of the latter being yeIIOW, with a common sutural patch before the middle, a
short streak below the shoulders, an oblong patch at the sides below the middle
(connected with the rather narroW, post-median, transverse, marginal fascia), and some

scattered spots, black. The type from the Stockholm Museum is figured.

9. Gtenochira rubrocincta. (Tab.X111.figg. 3, 9 ; 4, var. oarmfex, 9 .)

Var. α. The inner part of the elytral margins from the base to the middle, as well as the entire disc, black.

Var. β. The disc of the prothorax and of the elytra, and the scutellum, obscure sanguineous or sanguineous.

The typical form of this species, which may be known from 0. plicata and its allies
by the elytral margins being suffused with dilute sanguineous internally‚ has been
collected in numbers in chiriqui. Of the varS. α and β (σανπξβθω, Boh.) single speci·
mens only bave been collected at each of the localities quoted3 the var. α merely differs
from 0. melanot‘m Boh. (which is probably an analogous variety of Ο. plicata), by the
colour of the elytral margins. Some of the specimens from Mexico and Chiriqui are
intel-mediate between 0. camzfi’oe and 0. rubrocincta. The disc of the elytra varies
in colour from entirely black to sanguineous; it has usually a very large triangular
