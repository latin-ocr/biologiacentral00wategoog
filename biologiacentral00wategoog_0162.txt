Hah. Mexico (Truqui, in Mus. Brit.).-001.onn1A1·³.

Tbere are two specimens of this species in the British Museum labelled as from
Mexico, M. evanida is exceedingly closely allied to M. exclamationis, and it is
probably nothing more than a variety of that insect.

18. Mesomphalia nigrolineata. (Tab. VI. fig. 17, «ς .)

Rotundate (d ), broad ovate ( 9 )‚ moderately eonvex, shining‚ flavo-testaceous or stramineous; the prothorax
with a narrow median vitta extending from the base to the apex, and the lateral margins from a little
before the middle to the base, black 3 the scutellum black; the elytra with the sature from the base to
the apex narrowly, a narrow stripe on the outer part of the dise extending from the base nearly to the
apex (bent inwards and a little widened at the base), and the exterior limb to beyond the middle ( d ), or
to about one-third from the base ( 9 )‚ very narrowly, black; the antennoe black, the four basal joints
testaceous‚ 2-4 infuscata above ; the under surfaoe and legs pale testaceous, the tibiae on their outer edge
and the tarsi blaek. Head deeply canaliculato, not visible from above3 antennae rather slender, the four
basa] joints shining, the others densely punctured and opaque. Prothorax twice as broad as long, very
feebly emarginate in front (the apex subtruncate‚ if viewed from above), the sides slightly rounded in
their basal third and thence rapidly and obliquely converging to the apex, the anterior angles obliterated,
the base feebly sinuate on either side, subtruncate outwarffly, the hind angles rather sharp, the median

’ lobe obtuse and moderately produced, the disc transversely depressed in the middle behind and with a
faint median groove‚ the margins concava, the apex raised3 the surface almost smooth‚ the sides only
with distinct puncturas. Scutellum smooth. Elytra about one-half broader than the prothorax, at t-he
base not much wider than it, conjointly rounded at the apex, the base moderately sinnam, the humeri
rounded and not prominent ; the disc regularly convex z the margins broadly expanded in tho ὅ , mode-

punctate. Beneath smooth, glabrous. Claws appendiculatc.

Hah. Cos'rA Rch (coll. ιῙιῑη.εςοη); mmm, Volcan de Chiriqui 4000 feet (Oltampion).

One specimenfrom each locality; the male, from Costa Rica, is figured. This species
approaches M. albida, M. exclamationi& &c.; but it has the margins of the elytra more
broadly expanded, especially in the male.

19. Mesomphalia interrupta. (Tab. VI. fig. 18, ῼ .)

Rotundate (6 )‚ rather broad ovate ( 9 ), moderately conv-ex, shining‚ dilute stramineous ; the prothorax with
a median vitta extending from the base to the apex, usually a little widened in front, and the lateral
margins narrowly from about the middle to the base, black3 the scutellum black3 the elytra with the
suture for a short distance immediately below the base, narrowly, a short slightly curved, oblique streak
on the humeral callus (extending to the base), and a fine longitudinal streak of variable length on the
