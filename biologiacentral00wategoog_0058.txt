acute and produced directly backwards3 the apical margin obtuse 3 the disc with ten,
the extreme base with eleven, rows of punctures; the sut-ure, together with the second
and fourth interspaces, thickened and subcostate3 humeral callus laterally produced,
acute3 the submarginal vitta, which extends considerably beyond the middle of the
elytron, is dilated at its base, and covers both the apex of the humeral callus and the
humeral margin3 the transverse stripe commences at the outer edge of the posterior
angle, runs along its hinder border, and extends inwards as far as the middle of the

disc.

Vertex and front impunctate, the upper portion of the latter impressed with a fine longi-
tudinal groove ; the interantennal space with a short tooth 3 either side of the vertex with
a broad piceo-fulvous patch, which extends downwards along the inner orbit of the eye.
Antennae three fourths the length of the body, slender; the third to the seventh joints
compressed, moderately dilated, the two lower ones short, nearly equal, the third⁴longer
than the preceding two united, the fourth rather shorter, the fifth, sixth, and seventh
gradually decreasing both in length and breadth. Thorax rather longer than broad3
sides straight, bisinuate, slightly but distinctly converging from the base to the apex 3 the
hinder angle laterally produced, acute3 the anterior angle armed with an oblique obtuse
tooth3 upper surface transversely convex, slightly flattened and excavated on the hinder
disc, closely and strongly variolose-punctate, the puncturing on the sides irregular and
much coarser than on the middle; a space immediately behind the anterior margin free
from punctures. Elytra convex, broader than the thorax, parallel before the middle,
very slightly dilated posteriorly, the lateral margin entire3 apex obtusely rounded, its
margin obsoletely serrulate3 posterior angle armed with a stout acute tooth, the apex of
which is directed backwards3 humeral callus distinct, obtuse, not laterally produced;
each ely-tren at its base with eleven, the rest of its surface with ten, longitudinal rows
of large deeply impressed punctures, which cover the whole surface. Legs slender,
elongate; basal halves of all the femora fulvous.

18. Cephalodonta abbreviata.

Elongata, poetice vix ampliata, nitida, subtus piceo-nigra3 pectoris medio, thoracis plaga laterali, abdominis basi,
