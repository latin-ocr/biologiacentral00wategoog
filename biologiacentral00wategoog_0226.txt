210 PHYTOPHAGA.

Hah. Pmnu, David and Caldera in Chiriqui (Champion).—COLOMBIA 1‘3.

Found in abundance by myself in the low country of Chiriqui. A small, convex
species, subrotundate in shape3 the elytra with the disc black or fusco-castaneous,
with numerous, feebly raised, irregularly-shaped yellow spotS, the margins broad and
flavo-hyaline; the antennae elongate, the third and fourth joints long and subequaL
the apical three infuscate or black. The coloration of the elytra resembles that of

Charidotis auroquttatm but the elytral spots are more irregular in sh ape (not so
rounded) and less raised.

A common insect in Mexico and Guatemala. It varies in the colour of the
underside, from entirely testaceous to black, with the margins of the abdomen
narrowly testaceous, specimens from the same locality varying in this way. 0. bzfossu-
lata (the type of which is before me) is described as having the underside testaceous‚
with a large patch on either side of the metasternum black3 0. dubitabilis as black‚
with the margins of the abdomen rather broadly testaceouS. The different forms
have been collected in company at ChilpancingO, Misantla‚ Cordova, capet-illo, &c.‚
and they cannot be maintained as distinct. In a few specimens from various places
in Mexico the punctures of the elytral series are very lightly impressed and much
more widely separated than usual. 0. bzfossulata closely resembles the following
species, 0. tffsiqnata. but it is larger, and has more expanded margins to the elytra
and a deeper discoidal fovea. The dilute blackish spots are small or indistinct,
in some specimens obsolete: two or three are sometimes visible on each elytron‚ as
in the following species; Boheman only mentions ¹ 4 the one in the fovea. · The
metamorphoses of this species have been described and figured by Dr. E. Duges (Ann.
Soc. Ent. Belg. 1887, pp. 143-145‚ t. 2. figg. 1-10), who gives the food·plant as

Ipomoea murucoides.
