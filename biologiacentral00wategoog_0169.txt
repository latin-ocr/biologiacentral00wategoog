Hah. anco (Mus. Paris 1‘²’·).

I have not seen a Chelymorpha agreeing with the description of this species. The
spots on each elytron are arranged 2, 3, 1, 2.

11. chelymorpha rugicollis. (sab. vn. fig. 4, 52 .)

ῼ . Oblong ovate, moderately convex, slightly shining, somcwhat thickly pubescent 3 rufo-testaceous, the eyes,
six spots on the prothorax—four, equidistant‚ in a transverse line across the middle (the two on the disc
larger than the others), and two on the disc at the base, the latter small and faint,—and the scutellum,
black3 the elytra each with seven large rounded spots—three placed one behind the other on the disc
towards the suture (the first at the base, the second just behind and almost confluent with it, the third
about the middle, the latter lar-ger than the others and nearer the suture), three on the outer part of the
disc (the first on the humera] callus, the second a little before the middle, and the third not far from the
apex, the latter the largest), and one on the margin a little beyond the middle‚—and a common, large,
oblong patch on the suture below the base, blaek; the antennae (joints 3-11 broken off) and legs rufo-
testaceous; the under surface black, the ventral segments 3-5 each with a reddish transverse mark at
the sides. Head rugoeely punctured and canaliculato between the eyes, the lower part with coarse,
separate punctures3 (antennas mutilated). Prothorax nearly twice as broad as long, moderately convex,
broadly arcuate-emarginate in front, the sides rapidly converging from the base forwards—e. little rounded
behind, obliquely converging in front,-—the base deeply bisinuate on either side, the median lobe strongly,
subtriangnlarly produced, the hind angles sharply produced behind ; the disc with an abbreviated distinet
median groove3 the apical and lateral margins strongly thickened and reflexed‚ concave within3 the
entire surface coarsely, confluently punctured. Elytra regularly and moderately convex, about three
times as long as the prothorax, and at the base a little wider than it, widest at the middle, the sides
thence to the base sinuously converging, very obtuse behind, the humeri obtuse and embraced by the hind
angles of the prothorax; the margins narrowly expanded, with the outer edge thickened and slightly
reflexed 3 the surface coarsely, thickly punctate, the spots smoother. Beneath very sparsely, finely
mactate, sparsely pubescent; prosternum very deeply sulcate. Claws appendiculate.

Length 11, breadth 73} millim.

Hah. Mance, Michoacan (δἀἰίἑ).

One example. This very distinct species resembles O. comata, Boh., but is in reality
more nearly allied to the N Orth-American 0. arque (Herbst). The elytra are not at all
gibbous below the base, this character separating it at once from 0. comata and its
allies. The pubescent, duller surface, coarser punctuation, Sto, distinguish it from
0. arque, C'. mexicana, &e The prothorax is coarsely, confluently punctured.
