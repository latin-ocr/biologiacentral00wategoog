Taboga Ι. (Champz'on), Panama city (Walter).

A common insect in Central America‚ ranging from the Mexican State of Durango
right down to Panama, and probably extending into the northern parts of South
America. O. leprosa is doubtfully recorded by Boheman 3 as from Brazil.

'l'he rows of coarse punctures on the elytra are interrupted beyond the middle by an
oblique, smooth, fiavous space, which becomes much wider externally, and is much
more raised in some specimens than in others. The elytra have anabrupt, strongly
raised, transverse elevation across the suture below the base, this and a spot on the
humeral callus being usually sanguineous or dilute castaneous. The antennae are very
elongate and filiform‚ the third joint nearly three times as long as the second.

We figure a specimen from GhontaleS, agreeing perfectly with the (somewhat
discoloured) type.

5. Coptooyola dorsoplagiata. (Tab. X. figg. 5, 63 5 a, profile3 5 b, antenna.)

Rotundate, convex, dilute flavo-testaceous‚ shining; the elytra flavous‚ with the suture narrowly‚ a transverse
spot at the summit of the post-basa] elevation, the punctures on a broad space between it and the apex
of the disc (widened anteriorly and posterior-ly), and the fourth to the sixth rows of punctures to about
one third from the base, castaneous or dilute castaneous; the antenna-'2 testaceous, with the apical three
joints partly or entirely black3 the legs and under surfaee testaceous. Antennae very elongate, slender,
filiform‚ joints 3-10 elongate and subequal‚ 3 more than twice as long as 2. Prothorax subtrapezoidal,
the base deeply sinuate on either side of broad median lobe and abruptly and obliquely truncated
laterally‚ the apex rounded; broadly expanded‚ reticulate, and subhyaline in front and at the sides ς the
sur-face almost smooth, the disc obsoletely canaliculate. Elytra very much wider than, and about three
times as long as, the prothorax, conjointly rounded at the apex in the female, more obtuse behind in the
male, very deeply sinuato-emarginate at the base, with rounded prominent humeri3 the disc convex,
transversely gibbous below the base, and excavate on either side ol? the suture before this, with rows of
very coarse deep punctures, which are interrupted before the middle by a >-shaped smooth elevation
extending from the post-hasal elevation outwards‚ the punctures themselves crowded upon a broad space
between this and the apex and remote upon the rest of the surface, the interstices smooth and uneven3
the margins exceedingly broadly expanded‚ becoming narrow at the apex, smooth, reticulate, and sub-
hyaline, separated from the disc by a row of deep punctures, and transversely plicate internally a little

before the middle. Claws simple.
Lcngth 10-103, breadth 93-103 millim.

Hah. Mnx1co(Mu3. Brit.); GUATEMALA, Chacoj in Vera Paz, Zapote (Champion);
NICARAGUA‚ Chontales (Belt)'; Cos'rA R1cA ( Van Patten).

Six examples. This species is allied to the Cuban 0. dorsopunctata (Boh.) (and the
Mexican specimen referred to that species by Boheman no doubt belongs here) ; but
differs constantly from it in having the crowded castaneous punctures limited to a
narrower space on the elytra, the sparsely punctured flavous lateral spaces being much
more extended. It differs from 0. leprosa in having the elytra less gibbouS, and the

rows of punctures not interrupted beyond the middle by a transverse, smooth, irregular
fascia 3 and from C'. contempta by the less gibbous elytra and smooth margins.
