CISTUDmEL11A.—PHYsoNorA. 165

mesosternum, deeply grooved on either side posteriorly (but not down the middle); claws divaricata,
simple; form elliptic or oval.

This genus is proposed for the South-American Chelymorplza punctipeomis, C'. apiata,
and Ο. obducta, Boh., and for the new species from Chiriqui described below ⁴⁸. In
C'helymmjpha the head is not so deeply inserted, it being usually prominent, the pro·
sternal process is deeply sulcate down the middle, and the claws are appendiculam,
i. e. angularly dilated on the lower side towards the base.

1. Gistudinella foveolata. (Tab. V111.fig. 8, «ς .)

<3 . Subelliptic, conve x, rather broad, shining‚ testaceous, the expanded margins of the prothorax and elytra
somewhat pellucidz the eyes and antennae black, the five basal joints of the latter testaceous 3 the body
beneath black, the ventral segmenta broadly bordered with testaceous3 the legs entirely testaceous.
Antennae about reaching the base of the prothorax; joints 6-11 rather stout and compressed, 6-10 as
broad as long, 11 acuminate, longer than 10. Prothorax twice as broad as long, very rapidly, arcuately
converging from the base, rounded in front and ·projecting over the head, the base broadly arcuate-
emarginate on either side, the median lobe produced, rounded at the tip, the hind anglae sharp3 the disc
transversely depressed in the middle before the base; the margins broadly expanded, deeply transversely
depressed in front and behind, reticulate3 the surface smooth, the disc only with a few fine, scattered
punctures at the base. Elytra about two and a half times as long as, and at the sides forming almost a
continuone outline with, the prothorax, conj ointly rounded at the apex; the disc transversely convex
before the middle and then somewhat obliquely declivous to the apert, with coarse, deep, widely semema,
subserially arranged black punctures, the interspaces smooth and flat3 the margins rather broadly
expanded, smooth, reticulate; the humeri obtuse and embraced by the hind angles of the prothorax.

Beneath shining‚ almost smooth.
Leugth 7, breadth δὲ minim.

Hah. PANAMA, David in Chiriqui (Champion).

One specimen. Closely allied to the Brazilian 0. apiata, Boh., but differing from
it in having the prothorax less dilated at the sides anteriorly (more rapidly converging
from the base), and the elytral punctures much less numerous, the interspaces quite
flat; the general shape is also more elliptic.

PHYSONOTA.

Phyconota, Chevrolat‚ Dej. Cat. 3rd edit. p. 398 (1837),· Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. ii. p. 190
(1854) (partim) ; Chapuis, Gen. Col. xi. p. 386.

The name Phyconota is here adopted solely for those species that have the claws
simple, Boheman having also included under it, as noted by Chapuis, some South-'
American forms (P. fuscula, 810.) with the claws appendiculate. The metropolis of
Physo‘nota would appear to be in MexicO, though only one or two representatives occur
north of our boundary3 the species are all American, ranging from Canada to
Chili. Many of the species of Phyconota, and of the genera that follow, are, as is well

known, brilliantly metallic golden in life.

Ψ Other undescribed south-American species exist in collectione.
