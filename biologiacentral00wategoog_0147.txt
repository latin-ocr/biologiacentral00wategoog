PonrffrnAsPIs.—TAUROMA. 131

sharply raised. So far as it goes», the imperfect description of P. reticulata agrees
very nearly with P. flea-noem but there are discrepancies in several details. The very
sharply raised carinae form two zigzag series on the disc of each elytron, these being
here and there connected with each other and with the suture before the middle by
oblique rami. Our figure and description are taken from the Bugaba specimen.

3. Porphyraspis marginata. (Tab. V. fig. 12.)

Rotundate, short, very convex, pitchy-black, very shining, the margins of the prothorax and elytra, narrowly‚
the front of the head, the antennae, legs, and under surface, flavo- or rufo-testaceous. Head almost
smooth, finely canaliculato in front ; antennae short, only extending a little beyond the humeri,
considerably thickened towards the tip. Prothorax short, broadly and deeply emarginate in from, and
moderately dilated at the sides; the sides rounded‚ crenulate and somewhat obliqnely converging
anteriorly3 tho anterior angles dentiform ; the disc convex, smooth behind, rather coarsely punctured in
front3 the lateral portione deeply excavato, and exceedingly coarsely punctured. Scutellum almost
smooth. Elytra very much wider than the prothorax, short, rounded at the sides, widest at the middle,
deeply emarginate in front, obtuse behind, the humeri prominent and somewhat dentiform3 the disc
gibbous‚ with irregular series of coarse, deep, partly confluent impressione, and a prominent, smooth,
humeral callus, the sutura sharply raised, a sharp carina extending obliquely outwards from it before the
middle, this being connected anteriorly with a carina extending forwerda to the base midway between
the humeral callus and the sature, and posteriorly with a carina extending along the second interstice to
the apex, the other interspaces irregularly transversely plicate; the margins moderately expanded, with

· series of very coarse puncturas, the interspaces transversely plicate. Beneath shining, almost smooth.
Length 33-33, breadth 3 minim.

Six examples. In having the prothorax and elytra margined with flavo-testaceous,
this small species resembles P. ruqosa, Boh., from Brazi13 but it differs from that
insect in the sculpture of the prothorax and elytra, and in its smaller size. The
sculpture of the elytra somewhat resembles that of P. sanquinea (Fabr.), P. coccinea,

Boh., &c.

Tauroma, Hope, Ann. Nat. Hist. iii. p. 97, t. 4. fig. 4 (1839) ; Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. p. 113.
Tauroma, subg. Omocera, Chapuis, Gen. Col. xi. p. 373.

A Tropical·American genus containing numerous species, two only of which belong
‘to the Central-American fauna. According to Chapuis’s arrangement, both these
belong to his subgenus Omocera, Tauroma proper belonging to the South-American
continent.
