Common in the central and western parts of Mexico. Six varieties of this species
are described by Boheman, and to these may also be added 0. fasciam, the type of
which is contained in the British Museum. We have received two specimens of the
variety fasciam from Michoacan; it differs from typical 0. biannularis in having the
median fascia well defined, and disconnected from the posterior markingS. We figure
two male example8‚ one of which (fig. 11) represents the var. fasc-iata.

Most of the specimens I have seen of this species are from the Mexican State of
Puebla. Ι have examined the type of 0. 16·stillata in the British Museum‚ and also
a specimen of 0. conjuqata (ό) named by Boheman himself in the same collection:
the former* is inseparable from 0. let-punctam the latter is a variety of the same
species with the two posterior spots obliterated, and has been received with the typical
form from Matamoros Izucar. The elytra have each six rather large black spotS,
arranged 2, 2, 2, the posterior two very obliquely placed, each pair showing a tendency
to become coalescent, and the suture is sometimes black at the base ; the prothorax
has two large black spots placed transversely on the disc. We figure a typical
example (female) from Puebla (fig. 12); a female, from AcapulcO‚ agreeing with the
type os C. 16-stillata in the British Museum (fig. 13); and a male, from Matamoros

Izucar‚ agreeing with a specimen named as 0. cony'uqata by Boheman in the same
collection (fig. 14).

18. Chelymorpha lii-maculata. (Tab.V11.fig.15‚9.)

Hah. Mssxlco 1-3.
'⁸' This has six spots on each elytron, as in typical 0. 14-pvmctata3 Boheman* gives seven.
