COPTOCYCLA. 187

6. Coptocycla marmorata. (Tab. X. figg. 2, ῼ; 2 a, profile.)

Subrotundate (d ), broad oval ( ῼ ), eonvex, dilute flavo-testaceous, shining; the elytra with the sutnre, the
humeral callus, the puncturas, and some scattered spots and markings castanaeus or mfo-castaneous; the
legs and antennoe testaceous or rufo-testaceous; the body beneath black, with the sides testaceous, the
abdomen testaceous or rufo-testaceous, the segmenta broadly infuscate or blaek in the middle. Antennoe
elongate, slender, filiform, the apical five joints slightly thickened, joint 3 twice as long as 2, 3-11 sub-
equal in length. Prothorax as in Ο. dorsoplayiata. Elytra very much wider than, and about three times
as long as, the prothorax, conjointly rounded at the apex in both saxee, very deeply sinuato-emarginate
at the base, with prominent obtuse humeri; the disc convex, feebly transversely gibbous below the base,
and excavato on either side of the suture before this, with rows of very coarse deep punctnreS, which are
interrupted by a >-shaped smooth elevation extending from the post-basal elevation outwards and by
various oblique or transverse raised spaces which here and there connect the interstices, the latter smooth
and very uneven; the margins moderately expanded‚ becoming narrow at the apex, smooth, reticulate,
and subhyaline, separated from the disc by a row of deep puncturas, and transversely plicata internally a

little before the middle. Claws simple.
Leugth 9-93, breadth 8 minim.

Hah. anco, Venta de Zopilote and Mescala‚ both in Guerrero (H. H. Smith).

Three specimenS. Allied to G. leprosa, but smaller; the elytra feebly gibbous, with
less expanded margins», the interstices here and there connected by strongly raised

oblique or transverse elevations3 the body beneath partly black.

7. Coptocycla rufonotata.

Rotundate, convex‚ dilute flavo-testaceous, shining; the elytra with a short streak on the humeral callus, the
summit of the post-hasal elevation‚ and the puncturas rufo-castanaeus3 the antennae, legs, and under
surface flavo-testaceous. Antennoe and prothorax as in Ο. dorsoplayiata, the prothorax obsoletely canali-
culate at the base only. Elytra one half wider than, and three times as long as, the prothorax, conjointly
rounded at the apex, very deeply sinuata-emarginate at the base, with prominent rounded humeri ; the
disc convex, feebly transversely gibbous below the base, and moderately excavata on either side of the
suture before this, deeply foveate in the eentre before the middle, and with rows of coarse deep puncturas,
which are interrupted (the sutural row excepted) by slightly raised smooth spaces extending outwards
and downwards from the post-hasal elevation‚ and by a broad, slightly raised, smooth, impunctate‚ post·
median fascia, the latter widened externally and extending forwards to the ante-median marginal plica
and posteriorly to the apex (enclosing a punc-tnred ante-apical triangular space near the sutura), the inter-
stices smooth; the margins exceedingly broadly expanded‚ becoming narrower (though still wide) at the
apex, smooth, reticulate, and subhyaline, separated from the disc by a row of rather fine puncturas, and
transversely plicato a little before the middle. Claws simple.

Length 103, breadth 10 minim.
Hah. Cosm RIcA (Gabb, in coll. Janson).

One specimen, evidently of the male sex, This insect resembles 0. leprosa, from
which it may be known by the elytra being feebly gibbous‚ more broadly margined
at the apeX, and with the rows of punctures interrupted posteriorly by a very
large, smooth, slightly raised, impunctate space, the latter obliquely cut off in front
and enclosing a, triangular punctured space on either side of 'the suture before the

apex.
