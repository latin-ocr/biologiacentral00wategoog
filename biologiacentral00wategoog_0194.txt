1 78 PHYTOPHAGA.

the yellow transverse antemedian lateral patch on the elytra reduced to a small spot,
and in one of the San Geronimo examples it is entirely obsolete. 0. callosa, Boh.,

from Texas, appears to be a very close ally of this species,

HYBOSA.
Hybosa‚ Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. iii. p. 1 (1855).

Eight species of this Tropical-American genus have been described, one only of which
enters our region. Hybosa is chiefly distinguished by the base of the prothorax being
strongly bisinuate on either side, with a broadly produced obtuse median lobe.

1. Hybosa mollicula. (Ταῦ. ΙΧ. fig. 18, 9 .)
Hybosa mellicula, Boh. Monogr. Cassid. iv, p. 366 ²5 Dohrn, Stett. ent. Zeit. 1883, p. 106².

Hah. Msxrco (coll. Baly); GUATEMALA, Panzos in Vera Paz (Conradt) ; NrcARAeuA,
Chontales (Jamon).—-AMA20N8 ¹ 2.

The type in the Baly collection is a female: the male is rotundate. much less
elongate. The four specimens before me from Central America include both sexes;
the females agree perfectly with the type.

CHARIDOTIS.
Char-idetis, Boheman, Monogr. Cassid. iii. p. 7 (1855) (part.).

The species here referred to Charidotis agree in the following particulare 2—Antennae
short, not extending beyond the base of the prothorax; joint 3 very short, much shorter
than, and not nearly so stout as, 2; joints 4-6 each much longer than 3, 7-11 stout‚
8-10 not longer than broad. In the south-American Ο. miniata, placed by Boheman at
the head of the genus, joints 4 and ὃ are subequal, each twice as long as 3, the latter
very short, and 6-11 are thickened. Boheman included various species under Coptocycla,
such as 0. falzroei, 0. circumducta, 0. zomata, &c., with an equally short third antennal
joint; but these species have longer antennae, with the joints subfiliform or gradually
thickening outwardly. Sixty species of Char-{dotis have been described, all Tropical·
American, the genus ranging as far north as the Mexican State of Vera Cruz. N ine
species only are known to me from within our limits, all of which appear to be very
rare. As understood here, several species placed by Boheman under Charidotis belong

to Coptocycla, e. g. Ο. circulzfera διο.

Prothorax and elytra not unicolorous.
M argius of prothorax and elytra entirely yellow.
Base of prothorax and disc of elytra sanguineous, the latter with
large, transverse, smooth flavous callosities ........ pustulata, n. sp.
Disc of prothorax and elytra castaneous, the latter with small, sub-
serially arranged, smooth flavous callosities ........ αηνοφιίἰαία, Boh.
