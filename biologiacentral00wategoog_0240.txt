Ver. a. The spots on the prothorax almost obliterated, and the faseioe on the elytral margins abbreviated.
(Var. a, Boh.)

Hah. Nmmaui, chontaies (Batti-boman.

Var. β. The elytra with a broad common transverse patch at the base, a emsller transverse mark below it, the
two connected along the sutum, two or three fascioe below the middle, and some scattered spots, black or

piceous 3 the scutellum infuscate or piceous. (Fig. 20.)

The typical form i's not uncommon in Chiriqui. The variety β (fig. 20), of which
three specimens only have been obtained, is connected with the type by intermediate
gradatione ; it closely resembles 0. dissimilis, but may be known from it by the addi-

tional fascia on the elytral margins,

One specimen, agreeing perfectly with a specimen from Chevrolat's collection (pro-
bably the type) in the British Museum. In this species the prothorax has a large
subtriangular black patch‚ marked with three yellow spots—one median and one on
either side (the latter not surrounded with black extemally in the type); the scutellum
black; the elytra with the diso, and two transverse fasciae extending across the margins
nearly to the outer limb, black, the black deeply excined on either side of the disc at

the middle.

Sent in numbers from Τ eapa. This insect is closely allied to G. plicata3 but differs
from it in having the black dorsal patch of the elytra more or less emarginate on either
side at the middle, and usually with two broad black rami extending outwards from it
(to a greater or less extent) on to the margin, but not reaching the outer limb, The
elytra also have some small yellow or testaceous spots near the suture, which are rarely
absent. In pallid ‘examples the disc of the prothorax and of the elytra is castaneous.
The scutellum is yelloW. The antennae are flavous, with the tip of the apical joint
